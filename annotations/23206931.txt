The antioxidative response of grapevine leaves (Vitis vinifera cv. Trebbiano) affected by the presence of grapevine fanleaf virus was studied during the summer of 2010 at three different harvest times (July 1st and 26th, and August 30th). At the first and second harvest, infected leaves showed increases in the concentration of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, the latter increasing for enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase. In contrast, at the last harvest time, increases in the ascorbate pool and ascorbate peroxidase activity maintained hydrogen peroxide to control levels. The glutathione pool was negatively affected as summer progressed, showing a decrease in its total and reduced form amounts. At the same time, increases in the ascorbate pool were observed, making antioxidant defenses of grapevine effective also at the last harvest time. Increases in phenolic acids, and in particular in p-hydroxybenzoic acid, at the first and second harvest might have enhanced the efficiency of the antioxidant system through an interrelation between a peroxidase/phenol/ascorbate system and the NADPH/glutathione/ascorbate cycle. The lack of increase in p-hydroxybenzoic acid at the third harvest could be due instead to the enhanced utilization of this acid for hydrogen peroxide detoxification. With time, grapevine plants lost their capacity to contrast the spread of grapevine fanleaf virus, but acquired a greater ability to counteract pathogen-induced oxidative stress, being endowed with more reduced antioxidant pools.
