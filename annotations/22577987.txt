['22577987', 'Accumulating evidence shows that proper degradation of proteins that affect  defense responses in a positive or negative manner is critical in plant immunity.  However, the role of plant degradation systems such as the 26S proteasome in  plant immunity is not well understood. Loss-of-function mutations in EDR2  (ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 2) lead to increased resistance to the adapted  biotrophic powdery mildew pathogen Golovinomyces cichoracearum. To study the  molecular interactions between powdery mildew pathogen and Arabidopsis, we  performed a screen for suppressors of edr2 and found that mutation in the gene  that encodes RPN1a, a subunit of the 26S proteasome, suppressed edr2-associated  disease resistance phenotypes. In addition, RPN1a is required for edr1- and  pmr4-mediated powdery mildew resistance and mildew-induced cell death.  Furthermore, we show that rpn1a displayed enhanced susceptibility to the fungal  pathogen G. cichoracearum and to virulent and avirulent bacterial Pto DC3000  strains, which indicated that rpn1a has defects in basal defense and resistance  (R) protein-mediated defense. RPN1a-GFP localizes to both the nucleus and  cytoplasm. Accumulation of RPN1a is affected by salicylic acid (SA) and the rpn1a  mutant has defects in SA accumulation upon Pto DC3000 infection. Further analysis  revealed that two other subunits of the 26S proteasome, RPT2a and RPN8a are also  involved in edr2-mediated disease resistance. Based on these results, we conclude  that RPN1a is required for basal defense and R protein-mediated defense. Our data  provide evidence that some subunits of the 26S proteasome are involved in innate  immunity in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05048.x', 'Tang']
