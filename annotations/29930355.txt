['29930355', 'The ability of a cell to dynamically switch its chromatin between different  functional states constitutes a key mechanism regulating gene expression. Histone  mark "readers" display distinct binding specificity to different histone  modifications and play critical roles in regulating chromatin states. Here, we  show a plant-specific histone reader SHORT LIFE (SHL) capable of recognizing both  H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 via its bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) and plant homeodomain  (PHD) domains, respectively. Detailed biochemical and structural studies suggest  a binding mechanism that is mutually exclusive for either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3.  Furthermore, we show a genome-wide co-localization of SHL with H3K27me3 and  H3K4me3, and that BAH-H3K27me3 and PHD-H3K4me3 interactions are important for  SHL-mediated floral repression. Together, our study establishes BAH-PHD cassette  as a dual histone methyl-lysine binding module that is distinct from others in  recognizing both active and repressive histone marks.', '2018 Jun 21', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-018-04836-y', 'ORCID:']
