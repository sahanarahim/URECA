['10517826', 'The cytotoxic drug tunicamycin kills cells because it is a specific inhibitor of  UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-P transferase  (GPT), an enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of the biosynthesis of  dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. In the presence of tunicamycin,  asparagine-linked glycoproteins made in the endoplasmic reticulum are not  glycosylated with N-linked glycans, and therefore may not fold correctly. Such  proteins may be targeted for breakdown. Cells that are treated with tunicamycin  normally experience an unfolded protein response and induce genes that encode  endoplasmic reticulum chaperones such as the binding protein (BiP). We isolated a  cDNA clone for Arabidopsis GPT and overexpressed it in Arabidopsis. The  transgenic plants have a 10-fold higher level of GPT activity and are resistant  to 1 microg/mL tunicamycin, a concentration that kills control plants. Transgenic  plants grown in the presence of tunicamycin have N-glycosylated proteins and the  drug does not induce BiP mRNA levels as it does in control plants. BiP mRNA  levels are highly induced in both control and GPT-expressing plants by  azetidine-2-carboxylate. These observations suggest that excess GPT activity  obviates the normal unfolded protein response that cells experience when exposed  to tunicamycin.', '1999 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.121.2.353', 'Chrispeels']
