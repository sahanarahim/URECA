At least theoretically, plants may synthesize nitric oxide (NO) either by reduction of N in higher oxidations states, or by oxidation of more reduced N-compounds. The well established reductive pathway uses nitrite as a substrate, produced by cytosolic nitrate reductase. The only oxidative pathway described so far comprises nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like activity, where guanidino-N from L-arginine is oxidized to NO. In our previous paper we have demonstrated yet another form of oxidative NO formation, whereby hydroxylamine (HA), but also the AOX-inhibitor salicylhydroxamate (SHAM) is oxidized to NO by tobacco suspension cells. Oxidation of HA to NO was also demonstrated in vitro by using ROS producing enzymes. Apparently superoxide radicals and/or hydrogen peroxide served as oxidants. Another unexpected observation pointed to a special role for superoxide dismutase in oxidative NO formation.

NOS: !oxidizes! L-arginine 
ROS producing enzymes: !oxidize! HA 
superoxide radicals/hydrogen peroxide: !oxidize! HA 
superoxide dismutase: !plays role in! oxidative NO formation
