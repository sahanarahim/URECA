Cyanobacteria, progenitors of plant chloroplasts, provide a suitable model system for plants to study adaptation towards different abiotic stresses. Genome of the filamentous, heterocystous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7120 harbours a single gene (alr4641) encoding a typical 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins (2-Cys-Prxs). 2-Cys-Prxs are thiol-based peroxidases that also function as molecular chaperones in plants and other systems. The Alr4641 protein from Anabaena PCC7120 shows high level biochemical similarities with the plant 2-Cys-Prx. The physiological role played by the Alr4641 protein in Anabaena was addressed in this study. In Anabaena PCC7120, alr4641 transcript /Alr4641 protein was induced in response to abiotic stresses and its promoter was active in the vegetative cells as well as heterocysts. The wild-type Alr4641 protein or Alr4641 lacking the peroxidatic cysteine (Alr4641C56S) or the resolving cysteine (Alr4641C178S) existed as higher oligomers in their native form. The wild-type or the mutant Alr4641 proteins showed similar chaperone activity, but only the wild-type protein exhibited peroxidase activity indicating that unlike peroxidase activity, chaperone activity was not dependent on cysteines. In contrast to other 2-Cys-Prxs, chaperone/peroxidase activity of Alr4641 was dependent on its redox state and not oligomerization status. Alr4641 could protect plasmid DNA from oxidative damage and physically associate with NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (NTRC). Like 2-Cys-Prxs from plants (e.g. rice), Alr4641 could detoxify various peroxides using NTRC as reductant. On exposure to H2O2, recombinant Anabaena PCC7120 strain over-expressing Alr4641 (An4641+) showed reduced content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), intact photosynthetic functions and consequently better survival than the wild-type Anabaena PCC7120, indicating that Alr4641 can protect Anabaena from oxidative stress. The peroxidase/chaperone function of Alr4641, its inherent transcriptional/translational induction under different abiotic stresses and localization in both vegetative cells and heterocysts could be an adaptive strategy to battle various oxidative stresses that Anabaena encounters during its growth. Moreover, the recombinant Anabaena strain over expressing Alr4641 showed higher resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting its potential to serve as stress-tolerant biofertilizers in rice fields.
