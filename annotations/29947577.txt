Tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta, THW) is a voracious pest of tomato and potato. StZFP2 is a Q-type C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (TF) that is induced upon wounding and infestation. Previous work has shown that Q-type C2H2 TFs are involved in stress responses and when over expressed, can enhance protection against drought, salinity or pathogen infection. Twelve transgenic lines (S1-S12) were tested that over-express StZFP2. Feeding S6 or S8 to THW significantly lowered larval weight (21-37%) as well as increased expression of StPIN2 in comparison to untransformed Kennebec. The increase in StPIN2, a classic marker for insect defense in potato, is consistent with the decreases in larval weight gain.
