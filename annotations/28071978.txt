['28071978', 'The nuclear pore complex (NPC) comprises more than 30 nucleoporins (Nups). NPC  mediates macromolecular trafficking between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm,  but specific roles of individual Nups are poorly understood in higher plants.  Here, we show that the novel nucleoporin unique to angiosperm plants (designated  as Nup82) functions in a salicylic acid-dependent defense in a redundant manner  with Nup136, which is a component of the nuclear basket in the NPC. Arabidopsis  thaliana Nup82 had a similar amino acid sequence to the N-terminal half of Nup136  and a Nup82-GFP fusion was localized on the nuclear envelope. Immunoprecipitation  and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses revealed that Nup82  interacts with the NPC components Nup136 and RAE1. The double knockout mutant  nup82 nup136 showed severe growth defects, while the single knockout mutant nup82  did not, suggesting that Nup82 functions redundantly with Nup136. nup82 nup136  impaired benzothiadiazole (an analog of salicylic acid)-induced resistance to the  virulent bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Furthermore,  transcriptome analysis of nup82 nup136 indicates that deficiency of Nup82 and  Nup136 causes noticeable downregulation of immune-related genes. These results  suggest that Nup82 and Nup136 are redundantly involved in transcriptional  regulation of salicylic acid-responsive genes through nuclear transport of  signaling molecules.', '2017 May 4', 'Nucleus', '10.1080/19491034.2017.1279774', 'ORCID:']
