['19789277', 'Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatases are important negative  regulators of the levels and kinetics of MAP kinase activation that modulate  cellular responses. The dual-specificity phosphatase MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1  (MKP1) was previously shown to regulate MAP KINASE6 (MPK6) activation levels and  abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we report that the mkp1  null mutation in the Columbia (Col) accession results in growth defects and  constitutive biotic defense responses, including elevated levels of salicylic  acid, camalexin, PR gene expression, and resistance to the bacterial pathogen  Pseudomonas syringae. PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE1 (PTP1) also interacts with  MPK6, but the ptp1 null mutant shows no aberrant growth phenotype. However, the  pronounced constitutive defense response of the mkp1 ptp1 double mutant reveals  that MKP1 and PTP1 repress defense responses in a coordinated fashion. Moreover,  mutations in MPK3 and MPK6 distinctly suppress mkp1 and mkp1 ptp1 phenotypes,  indicating that MKP1 and PTP1 act as repressors of inappropriate  MPK3/MPK6-dependent stress signaling. Finally, we provide evidence that the  natural modifier of mkp1 in Col is largely the disease resistance gene homolog  SUPPRESSOR OF npr1-1, CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC1) that is absent in the Wassilewskija  accession. Our data thus indicate a major role of MKP1 and PTP1 in repressing  salicylic acid biosynthesis in the autoimmune-like response caused by SNC1.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.067678', 'Ulm']
