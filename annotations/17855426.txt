['17855426', 'Successful fertilization in plants requires the properly coordinated development  of female reproductive tissues, including stigma, style, septum and transmitting  tract. We have identified three closely related genes, HECATE1 (HEC1), HECATE2  (HEC2) and HECATE3 (HEC3), the expression domains of which encompass these  regions of the Arabidopsis gynoecium. The HEC genes encode putative basic  helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with overlapping functionality.  Depending on the amount of HEC function missing, plants exhibit varying degrees  of infertility, defects in septum, transmitting tract and stigma development and  impaired pollen tube growth. The observed phenotypes are similar to those  reported for mutations in the SPATULA (SPT) gene, which also encodes a bHLH  transcription factor required for development of the same female tissues. We show  that the HEC proteins can dimerize with SPT in a yeast two-hybrid system,  indicating that the HEC genes work in concert with SPT to coordinately regulate  development of the female reproductive tract. Furthermore, when the HEC genes are  ectopically expressed from the CaMV 35S promoter, some of the resulting  transgenic plants show pin-shaped inflorescences, suggesting that the HEC genes  are probably involved in auxin-mediated control of gynoecium patterning.', '2007 Oct', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.011510', 'Yanofsky']
