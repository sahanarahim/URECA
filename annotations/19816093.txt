Treatment with hydrogen peroxide has notable effects in the morphology of the root apex in Arabidopsis seedlings. The result was described as consisting in two aspects: first, a reduction in curvature values in the root profile. Second, alterations in size and shape of the cells in the root cap. Cells of the root cap were smaller and had higher circularity index (Fig. 1). The results of peroxide treatment were similar to alterations in the root apex of ethylene insensitive mutants and wild-type seedlings treated with ethylene inhibitors. This brings new evidence in favour of the association between ethylene and hydrogen peroxide signalling that was recently demonstrated in stomatal cells. Notable changes in morphology under peroxide treatment were previously reported in other biological systems (Fig. 2). In the following paragraphs we make emphasis on the need of an accurate analysis of morphology. This aspect has not received the attention required in biology, a discipline dominated by functional analysis. We suggest that the observed morphological characteristics in the root apex treated with peroxide may be the manifestation of global processes of adaptation in the organism. Alternative forms of roots grown in water or in peroxide are stable situations representing different global configurations that may have other (genomic, physiological) traits associated. Each form represents a different mode of adaptation to environmental change. The accurate description of morphology in organisms, with particular emphasis in model systems, and their variations under stress, is needed to identify and understand the basis of genomic organization and plasticity.
