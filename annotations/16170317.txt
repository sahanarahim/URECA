['16170317', 'Plant immune responses are usually accompanied by the production of extracellular  superoxide at and surrounding infection sites. Extracellular reactive oxygen  intermediates (ROIs) in plants were proposed to drive programmed cell death  correlated with disease resistance (the hypersensitive response). ROIs derived  from this oxidative burst are generated by plasma membrane NADPH oxidases,  anchored by gp91(phox) proteins related to those responsible for the respiratory  oxidative burst activated in mammalian neutrophils during infection. Mutation of  Arabidopsis thaliana respiratory burst oxidase (Atrboh) genes eliminated  pathogen-induced ROI production but had only a modest effect on the  hypersensitive response. We show that Atrboh function can be activated by  exogenous ROIs. Unexpectedly, the subsequent oxidative burst can suppress cell  death in cells surrounding sites of NADPH oxidase activation. This cell death  requires salicylic acid, a plant immune system activator. Thus, ROIs generated by  Atrboh proteins can antagonize salicylic acid-dependent pro-death signals. These  results have implications for understanding how salicylic acid activates defense  signaling in cells spatially removed from infection sites without causing cell  death.', '2005 Oct', 'Nat Genet', '10.1038/ng1639', 'Dangl']
