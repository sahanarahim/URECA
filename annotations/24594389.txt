The Arabidopsis genome encodes various proteins with a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Many of these proteins also contain nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and function as resistance (R) proteins. However, the protein encoded by At2g32140 (a TIR-X gene) contains a TIR domain but lacks NBS and LRR domains. We found that transgenic plants overexpressing At2g32140 displayed a dwarf phenotype and showed increased expression of defense-related genes. In general, the growth defect caused by activation of defense responses is suppressed under high-temperature conditions. However, transgenic plants overexpressing At2g32140 displayed a much stronger dwarf phenotype at 28°C than at 22°C. This dwarf phenotype was suppressed under the combination with known salicylic-acid pathway mutants. These findings suggest that At2g32140 encodes a protein involved in the plant defense response.
