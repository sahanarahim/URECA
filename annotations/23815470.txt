['23815470', "The pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) proteins belong to the super-family of  ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. AtPDR8, also called PEN3, is required  for penetration resistance of Arabidopsis to nonadapted powdery mildew fungi.  During fungal infection, plasma-membrane-localized PEN3 is concentrated at fungal  entry sites, as part of the plant's focal immune response. Here, we show that the  pen3 mutant is compromised in resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas  syringae pv. tomato DC3000. P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 infection or treatment  with a flagellin-derived peptide, flg22, induced strong focal accumulation of  PEN3-green fluorescent protein. Interestingly, after an initial induction of PEN3  accumulation, P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 but not the  type-III-secretion-deficient mutant hrcC could suppress PEN3 accumulation.  Moreover, transgenic overexpression of the P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 effector  AvrPto was sufficient to suppress PEN3 focal accumulation in response to flg22.  Analyses of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 effector deletion mutants showed that  individual effectors, including AvrPto, appear to be insufficient to suppress  PEN3 accumulation when delivered by bacteria, suggesting a requirement for a  combined action of multiple effectors. Collectively, our results indicate that  PEN3 plays a positive role in plant resistance to a bacterial pathogen and show  that focal accumulation of PEN3 protein may be a useful cellular response marker  for the Arabidopsis-P. syringae interaction.", '2013 Aug', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI-11-12-0262-R', 'He']
