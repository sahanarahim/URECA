Polyploidy is a prominent route to speciation in plants; however, this entails resolving the challenges of meiotic instability facing abrupt doubling of chromosome complement. This issue remains poorly understood. We subjected progenies of a synthetic hexaploid wheat, analogous to natural common wheat, but exhibiting extensive meiotic chromosome instability, to heat or salt stress. We selected stress-tolerant cohorts and generated their progenies under normal condition. We conducted fluorescent in situ hybridization/genomic in situ hybridization-based meiotic/mitotic analysis, RNA-Seq and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-mediated assay of meiosis candidate genes. We show that heritability of stress tolerance concurred with increased euploidy frequency due to enhanced meiosis stability. We identified a set of candidate meiosis genes with altered expression in the stress-tolerant plants vs control, but the expression was similar to that of common wheat (cv Chinese Spring, CS). We demonstrate VIGS-mediated downregulation of individual candidate meiosis genes in CS is sufficient to confer an unstable meiosis phenotype mimicking the synthetic wheat. Our results suggest that heritable regulatory changes of preexisting meiosis genes may be hitchhiked as a spandrel of stress tolerance, which significantly improves meiosis stability in the synthetic wheat. Our findings implicate a plausible scenario that the meiosis machinery in hexaploid wheat may have already started to evolve at its onset stage.

Candidate meiosis genes: !altered expression in! Stress-tolerant plants
VIGS-mediated downregulation: !confers! Unstable meiosis phenotype
Heritable regulatory changes: !hitchhiked as! Spandrel of stress tolerance
