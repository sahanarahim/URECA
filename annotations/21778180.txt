Relatively little is known about programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. It is nonetheless suggested here that tonoplast rupture and the subsequent rapid destruction of the cytoplasm can distinguish two large PCD classes. One class, which is here called 'autolytic', shows this feature, whilst the second class (called 'non-autolytic') can include tonoplast rupture but does not show the rapid cytoplasm clearance. Examples of the 'autolytic' PCD class mainly occur during normal plant development and after mild abiotic stress. The 'non-autolytic' PCD class is mainly found during PCD that is due to plant-pathogen interactions. Three categories of PCD are currently recognized in animals: apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. An attempt is made to reconcile the recognized plant PCD classes with these groups. Apoptosis is apparently absent in plants. Autophagic PCD in animals is defined as being accompanied by an increase in the number of autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and small lytic vacuoles produced by autolysosomes. When very strictly adhering to this definition, there is no (proof for) autophagic PCD in plants. Upon a slightly more lenient definition, however, the 'autolytic' class of plant PCD can be merged with the autophagic PCD type in animal cells. The 'non-autolytic' class of plant PCD, as defined here, can be merged with necrotic PCD in animals.
