Some time ago, potato transformants expressing Agrobacterium-derived auxin synthesis gene tms1 were generated. These tms1-transgenic plants, showing enhanced productivity, were studied for their hormonal status, turnover and responses in comparison with control plants. For this purpose, contents of phytohormones belonging to six different classes (auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic, jasmonic and salicylic acids) were determined by a sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method in tubers and shoots of in vitro grown plants. To date, this study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the potato hormonal system. On the basis of obtained results, several new generalizations concerning potato hormonal status were drawn. Overall, these data can serve as a framework for forthcoming integrative studies of the hormonal system in potato plants.
