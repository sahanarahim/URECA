['11605952', 'The Arabidopsis NPR1 protein is an essential regulatory component of systemic  acquired resistance (SAR). Mutations in the NPR1 gene completely block the  induction of SAR by signals such as salicylic acid (SA). An Arabidopsis mutant,  snc1 (suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1), was isolated in a screen for  suppressors of npr1-1. In the npr1-1 background, the snc1 mutation resulted in  constitutive resistance to Pseudomonas syringae maculicola ES4326 and Peronospora  parasitica Noco2. High levels of SA were detected in the mutant and shown to be  required for manifestation of the snc1 phenotype. The snc1 mutation was mapped to  the RPP5 resistance (R) gene cluster and the eds1 mutation that blocks  RPP5-mediated resistance suppressed snc1. These data suggest that a RPP5-related  resistance pathway is activated constitutively in snc1. This pathway does not  employ NPR1 but requires the signal molecule SA and the function of EDS1.  Moreover, in snc1, constitutive resistance is conferred in the absence of cell  death, which is often associated with R-gene mediated resistance.', '2001 Oct', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI.2001.14.10.1131', 'Dong']
