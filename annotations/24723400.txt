Previously, it was found that Nep1Mo (a Nep1-like protein from Magnaporthe oryzae) could trigger a variety of plant responses, including stomatal closure, hypersensitive cell death (HCD), and defence-related gene expression, in Nicotiana benthamiana. In this study, it was found that Nep1Mo-induced cell death could be inhibited by the virus-induced gene silencing of NbALY916 in N. benthamiana. NbALY916-silenced plants showed impaired Nep1Mo-induced stomatal closure, decreased Nep1Mo-induced production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) in guard cells, and reduced Nep1Mo-induced resistance against Phytophthora nicotianae. It also found that the deletion of AtALY4, an orthologue of NbALY916 in Arabidopsis thaliana, impaired Nep1Mo-triggered stomatal closure, HCD, and defence-related gene expression. The compromised stomatal closure observed in the NbALY916-silenced plants and AtALY4 mutants was inhibited by the application of H2O2 and sodium nitroprusside (an NO donor), and both Nep1Mo and H2O2 stimulated guard cell NO synthesis. Conversely, NO-induced stomatal closure was found not to require H2O2 synthesis; and NO treatment did not induce H2O2 production in guard cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the NbAlY916/AtAlY4-H2O2-NO pathway mediates multiple Nep1Mo-triggered responses, including stomatal closure, HCD, and defence-related gene expression.
