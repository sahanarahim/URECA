The presence of seed color in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) requires the dominant-acting P (pigment) gene, and white seed is a recessive phenotype in all domesticated races of the species. P was classically associated with seed size, thus describing it as the first genetic marker for a quantitative trait. The molecular structure of P was characterized to understand the selection of white seeds during bean diversification and the relationship of P to seed weight. P was identified by homology searches, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene remodeling, and confirmed by gene silencing. Allelic variation was assessed by a combination of resequencing and marker development, and the relationship between P and seed weight was assessed by a GWAS study. P is a member of clade B of subclass IIIf of plant basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. Ten race-specific P alleles conditioned the white seed phenotype, and each causative mutation affected at least one bHLH domain required for color expression. GWAS analysis confirmed the classic association of P with seed weight. In common bean, white seeds are the result of convergent evolution and, among plant species, orthologous convergence on a single transcription factor gene was observed.
