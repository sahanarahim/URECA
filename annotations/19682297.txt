['19682297', 'Arabidopsis gain-of-resistance mutants, which show HR-like lesion formation and  SAR-like constitutive defense responses, were used well as tools to unravel the  plant defense mechanisms. We have identified a novel mutant, designated  constitutive expresser of PR genes 30 (cpr30), that exhibited dwarf morphology,  constitutive resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the  dramatic induction of defense-response gene expression. The cpr30-conferred  growth defect morphology and defense responses are dependent on ENHANCED DISEASE  SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1), PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4), and NONRACE-SPECIFIC  DISEASE RESISTANCE 1 (NDR1). Further studies demonstrated that salicylic acid  (SA) could partially account for the cpr30-conferred constitutive PR1 gene  expression, but not for the growth defect, and that the cpr30-conferred defense  responses were NPR1 independent. We observed a widespread expression of CPR30  throughout the plant, and a localization of CPR30-GFP fusion protein in the  cytoplasm and nucleus. As an F-box protein, CPR30 could interact with multiple  Arabidopsis-SKP1-like (ASK) proteins in vivo. Co-localization of CPR30 and ASK1  or ASK2 was observed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Based on these results, we  conclude that CPR30, a novel negative regulator, regulates both SA-dependent and  SA-independent defense signaling, most likely through the ubiquitin-proteasome  pathway in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03995.x', 'Wang']
