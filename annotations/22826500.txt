['22826500', 'Transcriptional repression of pathogen defense-related genes is essential for  plant growth and development. Several proteins are known to be involved in the  transcriptional regulation of plant defense responses. However, mechanisms by  which expression of defense-related genes are regulated by repressor proteins are  poorly characterized. Here, we describe the in planta function of CBNAC, a  calmodulin-regulated NAC transcriptional repressor in Arabidopsis. A T-DNA  insertional mutant (cbnac1) displayed enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of  the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PstDC3000), whereas  resistance was reduced in transgenic CBNAC overexpression lines. The observed  changes in disease resistance were correlated with alterations in  pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) gene expression. CBNAC bound directly to the  PR1 promoter. SNI1 (suppressor of nonexpressor of PR genes1, inducible 1) was  identified as a CBNAC-binding protein. Basal resistance to PstDC3000 and  derepression of PR1 expression was greater in the cbnac1 sni1 double mutant than  in either cbnac1 or sni1 mutants. SNI1 enhanced binding of CBNAC to its cognate  PR1 promoter element. CBNAC and SNI1 are hypothesized to work as repressor  proteins in the cooperative suppression of plant basal defense.', '2012 Oct', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gks683', 'Chung']
