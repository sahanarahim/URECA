['21795714', 'The complexity of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells evolved to  provide distinct environments to regulate processes necessary for cell  proliferation and survival. A large family of predicted cation/proton exchangers  (CHX), represented by 28 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, are associated with  diverse endomembrane compartments and tissues in plants, although their roles are  poorly understood. We expressed a phylogenetically related cluster of CHX genes,  encoded by CHX15-CHX20, in yeast and bacterial cells engineered to lack multiple  cation-handling mechanisms. Of these, CHX16-CHX20 were implicated in pH  homeostasis because their expression rescued the alkaline pH-sensitive growth  phenotype of the host yeast strain. A smaller subset, CHX17-CHX19, also conferred  tolerance to hygromycin B. Further differences were observed in K(+)- and low  pH-dependent growth phenotypes. Although CHX17 did not alter cytoplasmic or  vacuolar pH in yeast, CHX20 elicited acidification and alkalization of the  cytosol and vacuole, respectively. Using heterologous expression in Escherichia  coli strains lacking K(+) uptake systems, we provide evidence for K(+) ((86)Rb)  transport mediated by CHX17 and CHX20. Finally, we show that CHX17 and CHX20  affected protein sorting as measured by carboxypeptidase Y secretion in yeast  mutants grown at alkaline pH. In plant cells, CHX20-RFP co-localized with an  endoplasmic reticulum marker, whereas RFP-tagged CHX17-CHX19 co-localized with  prevacuolar compartment and endosome markers. Together, these results suggest  that in response to environmental cues, multiple CHX transporters differentially  modulate K(+) and pH homeostasis of distinct intracellular compartments, which  alter membrane trafficking events likely to be critical for adaptation and  survival.', '2011 Sep 30', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111.252650', 'Sze']
