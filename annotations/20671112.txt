['20671112', 'Extracellular ATP induces a rise in the level of cytosolic free calcium  ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) in plant cells. To expand our knowledge about the function of  extracellular nucleotides in plants, the effects of several nucleotide analogs  and pharmacological agents on [Ca(2+)](cyt) changes were studied using transgenic  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) expressing aequorin or the fluorescence  resonance energy transfer-based Ca(2+) sensor Yellow Cameleon 3.6. Exogenously  applied CTP caused elevations in [Ca(2+)](cyt) that displayed distinct time- and  dose-dependent kinetics compared with the purine nucleotides ATP and GTP. The  inhibitory effects of antagonists of mammalian P2 receptors and calcium influx  inhibitors on nucleotide-induced [Ca(2+)](cyt) elevations were distinct between  CTP and purine nucleotides. These results suggest that distinct recognition  systems may exist for the respective types of nucleotides. Interestingly, a  mutant lacking the heterotrimeric G protein Gbeta-subunit exhibited a remarkably  higher [Ca(2+)](cyt) elevation in response to all tested nucleotides in  comparison with the wild type. These data suggest a role for Gbeta in negatively  regulating extracellular nucleotide signaling and point to an important role for  heterotrimeric G proteins in modulating the cellular effects of extracellular  nucleotides. The addition of extracellular nucleotides induced multiple temporal  [Ca(2+)](cyt) oscillations, which could be localized to specific root cells. The  oscillations were attenuated by a vesicle-trafficking inhibitor, indicating that  the oscillations likely require ATP release via exocytotic secretion. The results  reveal new molecular details concerning extracellular nucleotide signaling in  plants and the importance of fine control of extracellular nucleotide levels to  mediate specific plant cell responses.', '2010 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.162503', 'Stacey']
