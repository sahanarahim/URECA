ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters act mainly to transport compounds across cellular membranes and are important for diverse biological processes. However, their roles in pathogenesis have not been well-characterized in Fusarium graminearum. Sixty F. graminearum ABC protein genes were functionally characterized. Among them, FgArb1 regulates normal growth and importantly is essential for pathogenicity. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms of FgArb1 in pathogenicity were analyzed in this study. FgArb1 interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) FgSte7, and partially modulates plant penetration by regulating the phosphorylation of FgGpmk1 (the downstream kinase of FgSte7). The FgArb1 mutant exhibited dramatically reduced infective growth within wounded host tissues, likely resulting from its increased sensitivity to oxidative stresses, defective cell wall integrity and reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) production. FgArb1 also is important for the production of sexual and asexual spores that are important propagules for plant infection. In addition, FgArb1 is involved in the regulation of protein biosynthesis through impeding nuclear export of small ribosomal subunit. Finally, acetylation modification at sites K28, K65, K341 and K525 in FgArb1 is required for its biological functions. Taken together, results of this study provide a novel insight into functions of the ABC transporter in fungal pathogenesis.
