Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are closely related to defence reactions of plants against pathogens. A prominent role in the production of ROI has been attributed to the plant respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOH) of the human phagocyte GP91(phox). A barley RBOH, which encodes a putative superoxide (O2*-)) producing NADPH oxidase, is described here. Histochemical analysis of the barley-Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) interaction showed that O(2*-) is produced locally at the site of penetration. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced in non-penetrated cell wall appositions. A barley RBOHA cDNA was isolated and a minor induction of expression of RBOHA was observed during the interactions of barley with Bgh. Transient RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of HvRBOHA during the penetration process of Bgh led to an increase of basal penetration resistance. The results support a potential role of HvRBOHA in cellular accessibility to Blumeria graminis.
