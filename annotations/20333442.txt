RAV1 (Related to ABI3/VP1) proteins function as a transcription factor in signal transduction pathways in plants. The yeast-two-hybrid and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays identified the pepper (Capsicum annuum) oxidoreductase protein CaOXR1 that physically interacts with the pepper CaRAV1 transcription factor. The AP2 domain of CaRAV1 protein is essential for its direct interaction with CaOXR1. Both CaRAV1 and CaOXR1 proteins co-localize to the nuclei of plant cells. Virus-induced gene silencing of CaRAV1 and CaRAV1/CAOXR1 confers enhanced susceptibility to high salinity and osmotic stresses, which is accompanied by altered expression of the stress marker genes in pepper. Expression of CaAMP1 (pepper antimicrobial protein) and CaOSM1 (pepper osmotin) is suppressed by 1.2-6.6-fold in silenced leaves upon treatment with NaCl or mannitol. Overexpression of CaRAV1, CaOXR1 and CaOXR1/CaRAV1 in Arabidopsis also confers enhanced resistance to the biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis infection. In addition, CaRAV1- and CaOXR1/CaRAV1-overexpression (OX) Arabidopsis plants are highly tolerant to high salinity and osmotic stress. Together, these results suggest that CaOXR1 protein positively controls CaRAV1-mediated plant defense during biotic and abiotic stresses.
