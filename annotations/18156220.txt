['18156220', 'As the sun tracks daily through the sky from east to west, different parts of the  canopy are exposed to high light (HL). The extent of and mechanisms by which a  systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) response might preacclimate shaded leaves  that will be subsequently exposed to full sunlight is largely undefined. We  investigated the role of an Arabidopsis thaliana zinc finger transcription  factor, ZAT10, in SAA. ZAT10 overexpression resulted in enhanced tolerance to  photoinhibitory light and exogenous H2O2, increased expression of antioxidative  genes whose products are targeted to multiple subcellular compartments. Partial  HL exposure of a leaf or leaves rapidly induced ZAT10 mRNA in distal, shaded  photosynthetic tissues, including the floral stem, cauline leaves, and rosette,  but not in roots. Fully 86% of fivefold HL-upregulated and 71% of  HL-downregulated genes were induced and repressed, respectively, in distal,  shaded leaves. Between 15 and 23% of genes whose expression changed in the HL  and/or distal tissues were coexpressed in the ZAT10 overexpression plants,  implicating ZAT10 in modulating the expression of SAA-regulated genes. The SAA  response was detectable in plants with mutations in abscisic acid, methyl  jasmonate, or salicylic acid synthesis or perception, and systemic H2O2 diffusion  was not detected. Hence, SAA is distinct from pathogen-stimulated systemic  acquired resistance and apparently involves a novel signal or combination of  signals that preacclimate photosynthetic tissues to HL.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.045898', 'Pogson']
