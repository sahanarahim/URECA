['22080599', 'Plants coordinate and tightly regulate pathogen defense by the mostly  antagonistic salicylate (SA)- and jasmonate (JA)-mediated signaling pathways.  Here, we show that the previously uncharacterized glucosyltransferase UGT76B1 is  a novel player in this SA-JA signaling crosstalk. UGT76B1 was selected as the top  stress-induced isoform among all 122 members of the Arabidopsis thaliana UGT  family. Loss of UGT76B1 function leads to enhanced resistance to the biotrophic  pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and accelerated senescence but increased  susceptibility toward necrotrophic Alternaria brassicicola. This is accompanied  by constitutively elevated SA levels and SA-related marker gene expression,  whereas JA-dependent markers are repressed. Conversely, UGT76B1 overexpression  has the opposite effect. Thus, UGT76B1 attenuates SA-dependent plant defense in  the absence of infection, promotes the JA response, and delays senescence. The  ugt76b1 phenotypes were SA dependent, whereas UGT76B1 overexpression indicated  that this gene possibly also has a direct effect on the JA pathway. Nontargeted  metabolomic analysis of UGT76B1 knockout and overexpression lines using  ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry and activity assays with the recombinant  enzyme led to the ab initio identification of isoleucic acid  (2-hydroxy-3-methyl-pentanoic acid) as a substrate of UGT76B1. Exogenously  applied isoleucic acid increased resistance against P. syringae infection. These  findings indicate a novel link between amino acid-related molecules and plant  defense that is mediated by small-molecule glucosylation.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.088443', 'Schaffner']
