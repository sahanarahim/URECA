Possible links between plant defense responses and morphogenesis have been postulated, but their molecular nature remains unknown. Here, we introduce the Arabidopsis semi-dominant mutant uni-1D with morphological defects. UNI encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat protein that belongs to the disease resistance (R) protein family involved in pathogen recognition. The uni-1D mutation causes the constitutive activation of the protein, which is stabilized by the RAR1 function in a similar way as in other R proteins. The uni-1D mutation induces the upregulation of the Pathogenesis-related gene via the accumulation of salicylic acid, and evokes some of the morphological defects through the accumulation of cytokinin. The rin4 knock-down mutation, which causes the constitutive activation of two R proteins, RPS2 and RPM1, induces an upregulation of cytokinin-responsive genes and morphological defects similar to the uni-1D mutation, indicating that the constitutive activation of some R proteins alters morphogenesis through the cytokinin pathway. From these data, we propose that the modification of the cytokinin pathway might be involved in some R protein-mediated responses.
