The auxin-producing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 can promote the growth of several plant species. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was chosen as host plant to gain an insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern this interaction. The determination of differential gene expression in Arabidopsis roots after inoculation with either A.막rasilense wild-type or an auxin biosynthesis mutant was achieved by microarray analysis. Arabidopsis thaliana inoculation with A.막rasilense wild-type increases the number of lateral roots and root hairs, and elevates the internal auxin concentration in the plant. The A.맚haliana root transcriptome undergoes extensive changes on A.막rasilense inoculation, and the effects are more pronounced at later time points. The wild-type bacterial strain induces changes in hormone- and defense-related genes, as well as in plant cell wall-related genes. The A.막rasilense mutant, however, does not elicit these transcriptional changes to the same extent. There are qualitative and quantitative differences between A.맚haliana responses to the wild-type A.막rasilense strain and the auxin biosynthesis mutant strain, based on both phenotypic and transcriptomic data. This illustrates the major role played by auxin in the Azospirillum-Arabidopsis interaction, and possibly also in other bacterium-plant interactions.
