Root border cells lie at the interface between the root cap and the soil, secreting mucilage containing polysaccharides and molecules influencing microbial growth around the root. Border cells are sloughed off from the root surface, and the detachment is associated with secretion of xylogalacturonan (XGA). Recently, we showed that in alfalfa XGA secretion is mediated by large vesicles arising from the trans-Golgi in root cap cells. These vesicles are detected in precursor cells of border cells, but their fusion with the plasma membrane is observed only in border cells. We have now examined XGA secretion from maize border cells and Arabidopsis border-like cells using transmission electron microscopy and immunolabeling. In the root caps of both species, XGA is packaged into vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi, not in the vesicles from the trans-Golgi network as in the alfalfa root cap. Border cell-specific exocytosis of XGA was observed in the maize root suggesting that sorting and secretion of XGA in the root cap are conserved in monocot plants.
