['15980186', 'Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ethylene-responsive element binding protein  (AtEBP) gene was isolated as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional  screening in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). To further examine the cell death  suppressive action of AtEBP in plant cells, we established transgenic tobacco  (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing AtEBP as well as transgenic tobacco  plants ectopically expressing mouse Bax protein under a dexamethasone-inducible  promoter. We prepared the crosses of the selective lines of each transgenic  plant, which were evaluated in terms of cell death suppression activity. Results  indicate that AtEBP suppressed Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants, an  action also associated with a lowered level of ion leakage. Furthermore, tobacco  Bright Yellow-2 cells overexpressing AtEBP conferred resistance to hydrogen  peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and heat treatments. AtEBP protein localized in the nucleus  and functioned as an in vivo transcription activator as confirmed in transient  assays and experiments using stable transgenic system. Up-regulation of defense  genes was observed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtEBP. Based  on the analysis of mRNA accumulation in ethylene-related mutants, the position of  AtEBP in signaling pathway is presented.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.063586', 'Uchimiya']
