In response to an ultrasound pulse, several hundred DEGs, including in response to stress, were up- or down-regulated in in vitro potato plantlets. Despite this abiotic stress, plantlets survived. Ultrasound (US) can influence plant growth and development. To better understand the genetic mechanism underlying the physiological response of potato to US, single-node segments of four-week-old in vitro plantlets were subjected to US at 35 kHz for 20 min. Following mRNA purification, 10 cDNA libraries were assessed by RNA-seq. Significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were categorized by gene ontology or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes identifiers. The expression intensity of 40,430 genes was studied. Several hundred DEGs associated with biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and catabolism, cellular protein modification, and response to stress, and which were expressed mainly in the extracellular region, nucleus, and plasma membrane, were either up- or down-regulated in response to US. RT-qPCR was used to validate RNA-seq data of 10 highly up- or down-regulated DEGs, and both Spearman and Pearson correlations between SeqMonk LFC and RT-qPCR LFC were highly positive (0.97). This study examines how some processes evolved over time (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week and 4 weeks) after an abiotic stress (US) was imposed on in vitro potato explants, and provides clues to the temporal dynamics in DEG-based enzyme functions in response to this stress. Despite this abiotic stress, plantlets survived.
