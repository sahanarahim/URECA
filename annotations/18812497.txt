['18812497', 'A Polycomb-Group (PcG) complex, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS), represses  endosperm development in Arabidopsis thaliana until fertilization occurs. The  Hieracium genus contains apomictic species that form viable seeds asexually. To  investigate FIS function during apomictic seed formation, FERTILIZATION  INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), encoding a WD-repeat member of the FIS complex, was  isolated and downregulated in sexual and apomictic Hieracium species. General  downregulation led to defects in leaf and seed development, consistent with a  role in developmental transitions and cell fate. PcG-like activity of Hieracium  FIE was also supported by its interaction in vitro with the Arabidopsis CURLY  LEAF PcG protein. By contrast, specific downregulation of FIE in developing seeds  of sexual Hieracium did not result in autonomous endosperm proliferation but led  to seed abortion after cross-pollination. Furthermore, in apomictic Hieracium,  specific FIE downregulation inhibited autonomous embryo and endosperm initiation,  and most autonomous seeds displayed defective embryo and endosperm growth.  Therefore, FIE is required for both apomictic and fertilization-induced seed  initiation in Hieracium. Since Hieracium FIE failed to interact with FIS class  proteins in vitro, its partner proteins might differ from those in the FIS  complex of Arabidopsis. These differences in protein interaction were attributed  to structural modifications predicted from comparisons of Arabidopsis and  Hieracium FIE molecular models.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.059287', 'Koltunow']
