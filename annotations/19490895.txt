['19490895', 'Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a broad-spectrum plant immune response  involving profound transcriptional changes that are regulated by the coactivator  NPR1. Nuclear translocation of NPR1 is a critical regulatory step, but how the  protein is regulated in the nucleus is unknown. Here, we show that turnover of  nuclear NPR1 protein plays an important role in modulating transcription of its  target genes. In the absence of pathogen challenge, NPR1 is continuously cleared  from the nucleus by the proteasome, which restricts its coactivator activity to  prevent untimely activation of SAR. Surprisingly, inducers of SAR promote NPR1  phosphorylation at residues Ser11/Ser15, and then facilitate its recruitment to a  Cullin3-based ubiquitin ligase. Turnover of phosphorylated NPR1 is required for  full induction of target genes and establishment of SAR. These in vivo data  demonstrate dual roles for coactivator turnover in both preventing and  stimulating gene transcription to regulate plant immunity.', '2009 May 29', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2009.03.038', 'Dong']
