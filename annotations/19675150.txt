['19675150', 'Widespread antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern, and plants  represent an emerging antibiotic exposure route. Recent studies indicate that  crop plants fertilized with antibiotic-laden animal manure accumulate  antibiotics; however, the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic entry and  subcellular partitioning within plant cells remain unknown. Here, we report that  mutations in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) locus Multiple Antibiotic  Resistance1 (MAR1) confer resistance, while MAR1 overexpression causes  hypersensitivity to multiple aminoglycoside antibiotics. Additionally, yeast  expressing MAR1 are hypersensitive to the aminoglycoside G418. MAR1 encodes a  protein with 11 putative transmembrane domains with low similarity to  ferroportin1 from Danio rerio. A MAR1:yellow fluorescent protein fusion localizes  to the chloroplast, and chloroplasts from plants overexpressing MAR1 accumulate  more of the aminoglycoside gentamicin, while mar1-1 mutant chloroplasts  accumulate less than the wild type. MAR1 overexpression lines are slightly  chlorotic, and chlorosis is rescued by exogenous iron. MAR1 expression is also  down-regulated by low iron. These data suggest that MAR1 is a plastid transporter  that is likely to be involved in cellular iron homeostasis and allows  opportunistic entry of multiple antibiotics into the chloroplast.', '2009 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.143487', 'Lloyd']
