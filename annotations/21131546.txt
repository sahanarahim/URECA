The exodermis of Iris germanica roots is multiseriate. Its outermost layer matures first with typical Casparian bands and suberin lamellae. But as subsequent layers mature, the Casparian band extends into the tangential and anticlinal walls of their cells. Compared with roots in which the endodermis represents the major transport barrier, the multiseriate exodermis (MEX) was expected to reduce markedly radial water and solute transport. To test this idea, precocious maturation of the exodermis was induced with a humid air gap inside a hydroponic chamber. Hydraulic conductivity (Lp(pc)) was measured on completely submerged roots (with an immature exodermis) and on air-gap-exposed root regions (with two mature exodermal layers) using a pressure chamber. Compared with regions of roots with no mature exodermal layers, the mature MEX reduced Lp(pc) from 8.5×10(-8) to 3.9×10(-8) m s(-1) MPa(-1). Puncturing the MEX increased Lp(pc) to 19×10(-8) m s(-1) MPa(-1), indicating that this layer constituted a substantial hydraulic resistance within the root (75% of the total). Alternatively, a root pressure probe was used to produce pressure transients from which hydraulic conductivity was determined, but this device measured mainly flow through the endodermis in these wide-diameter roots. The permeability of roots to NaCl and ethanol was also reduced in the presence of two mature MEX layers. The data are discussed in terms of the validity of current root models and in terms of a potential role for I. germanica MEX during conditions of drought and salt stress.
