['12383081', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana NIM1/NPR1 gene product is required for induction of  systemic acquired resistance (SAR) by pathogens, salicylic acid (SA) or synthetic  SA analogs. We identified, in a yeast two-hybrid screen, two NIM1/NPR1  interacting proteins, TGA2 and TGA5, which belong to the basic region, leucine  zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors. Both TGA2 and TGA5 strongly  interact with NIM1/NPR1 in yeast and in vitro, and recognize the as-1 cis element  found within the promoter of several pathogenesis-related genes, such as PR-1. To  determine the role TGA2 and TGA5 may play in NIM1/NPR1-mediated disease  resistance, we introduced sense and antisense versions of both genes into  transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Characterization of TGA2 transgenic plants  revealed that inhibition or overexpression of TGA2 does not significantly affect  PR-1 expression or induction of SAR after pathogen infection or INA treatment.  Surprisingly, all TGA5-antisense transgenic plants produced showed increased  accumulation of TGA5 transcripts compared with untransformed control plants,  while the TGA5-sense lines showed no significant increase in TGA5 mRNA levels.  Interestingly, the high level of TGA5 mRNA in the antisense lines was accompanied  by significant resistance to a highly virulent isolate of the oomycete pathogen  Peronospora parasitica. Further, resistance was not coupled to accumulation of  products from the SAR-linked PR-1 gene following inoculation with P. parasitica  or treatment with INA, indicating that these plants express a robust,  PR-1-independent resistance mechanism. Resistance was retained when a  TGA5-accumulating line was combined genetically with a nim1-1 mutation or nahG  (salicylate hydroxylase) transgene, indicating that resistance in these plants is  due to an SA and SAR-independent mechanism.', '2002 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01411.x', 'Delaney']
