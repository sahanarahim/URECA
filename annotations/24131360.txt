Secondary metabolism plant glycosyltransferases (UGTs) ensure conjugation of sugar moieties to secondary metabolites (SMs) and glycosylation contributes to the great diversity, reactivity and regulation of SMs. UGT73B3 and UGT73B5, two UGTs of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), are involved in the hypersensitive response (HR) to the avirulent bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst-AvrRpm1), but their function in planta is unknown. Here, we report that ugt73b3, ugt73b5 and ugt73b3 ugt73b5 T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an enhanced cell death during the HR to Pst-AvrRpm1, whereas glutathione levels increased in the single mutants. In silico analyses indicate that UGT73B3 and UGT73B5 belong to the early salicylic acid (SA)-induced genes whose pathogen-induced expression is co-regulated with genes related to cellular redox homeostasis and general detoxification. Analyses of metabolic alterations in ugt mutants reveal modification of SA and scopoletin contents which correlate with redox perturbation, and indicate quantitative modifications in the pattern of tryptophan-derived SM accumulation after Pst-AvrRpm1 inoculation. Our data suggest that UGT73B3 and UGT73B5 participate in regulation of redox status and general detoxification of ROS-reactive SMs during the HR to Pst-AvrRpm1, and that decreased resistance to Pst-AvrRpm1 in ugt mutants is tightly linked to redox perturbation.
