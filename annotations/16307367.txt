Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in stress resistance in plants by modifying the expression of a battery of genes. In this paper, we report the identification of a group of early SA-regulated genes of Arabidopsis (activated between 0.5-2.5 h), using the cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism technique (cDNA-AFLP). Using 128 different primer combinations, we identified several genes based on their differential expression during SA treatment. Among these, we identified 12 genes up-regulated by SA whose patterns of induction were confirmed by Northern analysis. The identified genes can be grouped into two functional groups: Group 1: genes involved in cell protection (i.e. glycosyltransferases, glutathion S-transferases), and Group 2: genes involved in signal transduction (protein kinases and transcription factors). We also evaluated NPR1 requirement for the induction of the 12 up-regulated genes, and found that only those belonging to Group 2 require this co-activator for their expression. In silico analysis of the promoter sequences of the up-regulated genes, allowed us to identify putative cis-elements over-represented in these genes. Interestingly, as-1-like elements, previously characterized as SA-responsive elements, were specifically over-represented in Group 1 genes. The identification of early SA-regulated genes is an important step towards understanding the complex role of this hormone in plant stress resistance.
