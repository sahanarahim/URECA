Pathogen infection leads to the activation of defense signaling networks in plants. To study these networks and the relationships between their components, we introduced various defense mutations into acd6-1, a constitutive gain-of-function Arabidopsis mutant that is highly disease resistant. acd6-1 plants show spontaneous cell death, reduced stature, and accumulate high levels of camalexin (an anti-fungal compound) and salicylic acid (SA; a signaling molecule). Disruption of several defense genes revealed that in acd6-1, SA levels/signaling were positively correlated with the degree of disease resistance and defense gene expression. Salicylic acid also modulates the severity of cell death. However, accumulation of camalexin in acd6-1 is largely unaffected by reducing the level of SA. In addition, acd6-1 shows ethylene- and jasmonic acid-mediated signaling that is antagonized and therefore masked by the presence of SA. Mutant analysis revealed a new relationship between the signaling components NPR1 and PAD4 and also indicated that multiple defense pathways were required for phenotypes conferred by acd6-1. In addition, our data confirmed that the size of acd6-1 was inversely correlated with SA levels/signaling. We exploited this unique feature of acd6-1 to identify two genes disrupted in acd6-1 suppressor (sup) mutants: one encodes a known SA biosynthetic component (SID2) and the other encodes an uncharacterized putative metalloprotease (At5g20660). Taken together, acd6-1 is a powerful tool not only for dissecting defense regulatory networks but also for discovering novel defense genes.
