['19694953', 'SUMMARY Age-related resistance (ARR) occurs in numerous plant species, often  resulting in increased disease resistance as plants mature. ARR in Arabidopsis to  Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato is associated with intercellular salicylic acid  (SA) accumulation and the transition to flowering. Forward and reverse genetic  screens were performed to identify genes required for ARR and to investigate the  mechanism of the ARR response. Infiltration of SA into the intercellular space of  the ARR-defective mutant iap1-1 (important for the ARR pathway) partially  restored ARR function. Inter- and intracellular SA accumulation was reduced in  the mutant iap1-1 compared with the wild-type, and the SA regulatory gene EDS1  was also required for ARR. Combining microarray analysis with reverse genetics  using T-DNA insertion lines, four additional ARR genes were identified as  contributing to ARR: two plant-specific transcription factors of the NAC family  [ANAC055 (At3g15500) and ANAC092 (At5g39610)], a UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase  [UGT85A1 (At1g22400)] and a cytidine deaminase [CDA1 (At2g19570)]. These four  genes and IAP1 are also required for ARR to Hyaloperonospora parasitica. IAP1  encodes a key component of ARR that acts upstream of SA accumulation and possibly  downstream of UGT85A1, CDA1 and the two NAC transcription factors (ANAC055,  ANAC092).', '2009 Sep', 'Mol Plant Pathol', '10.1111/j.1364-3703.2009.00557.x', 'Cameron']
