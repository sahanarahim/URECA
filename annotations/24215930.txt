['24215930', 'Arabidopsis cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase 45 (CRK45) was found to be  involved in ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana previously. Here, we reported  that it also positively regulates disease resistance. The CRK45 overexpression  plants increased expression of the defense genes, and enhanced resistance to  Pseudomonas syringae whereas the crk45 mutant were more sensitive to P. syringae  and weakened expression of the defense genes, compared to the wild type. We also  found that treatment with P. syringae leads to a declined expression of CRK45 in  the npr1 mutant and the NahG transgenic plants. At the same time, significantly  decreased expression of CRK45 transcript in the wrky70 mutant than that in the  wild type was also detected. Our results suggested that CRK45 acted as a positive  regulator in Arabidopsis disease resistance, and was regulated downstream of NPR1  and WRKY70 at the transcriptional level.', '2013 Dec', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.10.024', 'Li']
