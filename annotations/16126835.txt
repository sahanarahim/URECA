['16126835', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana secretome was analyzed by the proteomic approach, which  led to the identification of secreted proteins implicated in many aspects of cell  biology. We then investigated the change in the Arabidopsis secretome in response  to salicylic acid and identified several proteins involved in pathogen response.  One of these, a secreted lipase with a GDSL-like motif designated GDSL LIPASE1  (GLIP1), was further characterized for its function in disease resistance. glip1  plants were markedly more susceptible to infection by the necrotrophic fungus  Alternaria brassicicola compared with the parental wild-type plants. The  recombinant GLIP1 protein possessed lipase and antimicrobial activities that  directly disrupt fungal spore integrity. Furthermore, GLIP1 appeared to trigger  systemic resistance signaling in plants when challenged with A. brassicicola,  because pretreatment of the glip1 mutant with recombinant GLIP1 protein inhibited  A. brassicicola-induced cell death in both peripheral and distal leaves.  Moreover, glip1 showed altered expression of defense- and ethylene-related genes.  GLIP1 transcription was increased by ethephon, the ethylene releaser, but not by  salicylic acid or jasmonic acid. These results suggest that GLIP1, in association  with ethylene signaling, may be a critical component in plant resistance to A.  brassicicola.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.034819', 'Park']
