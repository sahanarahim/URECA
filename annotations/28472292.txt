Plant growth and productivity is negatively affected by different stresses. Most stresses trigger calcium signals that initiate acclimation responses in plants. The multigene family of plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) functions in multiple stress responses by transducing calcium signals into phosphorylation events. This work reports that the OsCPK10 isoform positively mediates tolerance to different stresses in rice plants by enhancing their antioxidant capacity and protecting them from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, with the uncontrolled generation of ROS being a common feature of these stresses. Here, we show that the constitutive accumulation of an HA-tagged OsCPK10 full-length protein enhances the hydrogen peroxide detoxifying capacity of rice plants during desiccation. This is achived by modulating the accumulation of catalase proteins, which reduces the extent of lipid peroxidation and protects the integrity of cell membranes, resulting in drought tolerance. OsCPK10HA accumulation also confers blast disease resistance by interfering with fungal necrotrophic growth via a reduction in the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, we show by bimolecular complementation assays that OsCPK10 is a plasma membrane protein that physically interacts in vivo with catalase A. OsCPK10 therefore appears to be a good molecular target to improve tolerance to abiotic stresses as well as to blast disease, which limit rice crop productivity.
