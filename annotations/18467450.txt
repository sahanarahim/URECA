['18467450', 'Plant defense against pathogens depends on the action of several endogenously  produced hormones, including jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene. In certain defense  responses, JA and ethylene signaling pathways synergize to activate a specific  set of defense genes. Here, we describe the role of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) domain transcription factor  ORA59 in JA and ethylene signaling and in defense. JA- and ethylene-responsive  expression of several defense genes, including PLANT DEFENSIN1.2 (PDF1.2),  depended on ORA59. As a result, overexpression of ORA59 caused increased  resistance against the fungus Botrytis cinerea, whereas ORA59-silenced plants  were more susceptible. Several AP2/ERF domain transcription factors have been  suggested to be positive regulators of PDF1.2 gene expression based on  overexpression in stably transformed plants. Using two different transient  overexpression approaches, we found that only ORA59 and ERF1 were able to  activate PDF1.2 gene expression, in contrast to the related proteins AtERF1 and  AtERF2. Our results demonstrate that ORA59 is an essential integrator of the JA  and ethylene signal transduction pathways and thereby provide new insight into  the nature of the molecular components involved in the cross talk between these  two hormones.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.117523', 'Memelink']
