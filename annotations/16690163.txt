It has been proposed that salicylic acid (SA) acts as an endogenous signal molecule responsible for inducing abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The effect of varying salicylic acid (SA) supply (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0mM) on growth, mineral uptake, membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation, H(2)O(2) concentration, UV-absorbing substances, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations of NaCl (40 mM) stressed maize (Zea mays L.) was investigated. Exogenously applied SA increased plant growth significantly both in saline and non-saline conditions. As a consequence of salinity stress, lipid peroxidation, measured in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and membrane permeability was decreased by SA. UV-absorbing substances (UVAS) and H(2)O(2) concentration were increased by increasing levels of SA. SA also strongly inhibited Na(+) and Cl(-) accumulation, but stimulated N, Mg, Fe, Mn and Cu concentrations of salt stressed maize plants. These results suggest that SA could be used as a potential growth regulator to improve plant salinity stress resistance.
