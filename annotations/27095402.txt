['27095402', 'Algae wall polysaccharide, laminarin (Lam), has an established role on induction  of plant disease resistance. In this study, application of Lam increased  Arabidopsis fresh weight and enhanced tolerance to salt and heat stress by  stabilizing chloroplast under adverse environment. Transcriptome analysis  indicated that, in addition to induced a large number of genes associated with  the host defense, genes involved in the regulation of abiotic stress tolerance  mostly the heat stress response constituted the largest group of the up-regulated  genes. Lam induced expression of IRT1, ZIP8, and copper transporters involved in  transport of Fe, Zn, Cu ions associated with the activity of chloroplast  antioxidant system. Lam also up-regulated genes involved in the synthesis of  terpenoid, a plastidial-derived secondary metabolite with antioxidant activity.  Overexpression of a Lam-induced defensin like 202 (DEFL202) resulted in increased  chloroplast stability under salt stress and increased plant growth activity after  heat stress. Expression of antioxidant enzymes including SOD and ascorbate  peroxidase (APX), photosystem PsbA-D1 and ABA-dependent responsive to desiccation  22 (RD22) was induced to higher levels in the transgenic seedlings. In sum, our  results suggest that Lam is an potent inducer for induction of chloroplastic  antioxidant activity. Lam affect plant abiotic stress tolerance partially through  regulation of the DEFL-mediated pathway.', '2016 Jun', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.03.008', 'Chuang']
