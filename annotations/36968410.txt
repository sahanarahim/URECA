<i>Camellia oleifera</i> Abel is a highly valued woody edible oil tree, which is endemic to China. It has great economic value because <i>C. oleifera</i> seed oil contains a high맗roportion맖f polyunsaturated fatty acids. <i>C. oleifera</i> anthracnose caused by <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i>, poses a serious threat to <i>C. oleifera</i> growth마nd맟ield and causes the benefit of the <i>C. oleifera</i> industry to suffer directly. The WRKY transcription factor family members have been widely characterized as vital regulators in plant response맚o맗athogen말nfection. Until now, the number, type and biological function of <i>C. oleifera WRKY</i> genes are remains unknown. Here, we identified 90C<i>. oleifera</i> WRKY members, which were distributed across 15 chromosomes. <i>C. oleifera WRKY</i> gene expansion was mainly attributed맚o segmental duplication. We performed transcriptomic analyses to verify the expression patterns of <i>CoWRKYs</i> between anthracnose-resistant and -susceptible cultivars of <i>C. oleifera</i>. These results demonstrated that multiple candidate <i>CoWRKY</i>s can be induced by anthracnose and provide useful clues for their functional studies. <i>CoWRKY78</i>, an anthracnose-induced <i>WRKY</i> gene, was isolated from <i>C. oleifera</i>. It was significantly down-regulated in anthracnose-resistant cultivars. Overexpression of <i>CoWRKY78</i> in tobacco markedly reduced resistance맚o마nthracnose than WT plants, as evidenced by more cell death, higher malonaldehyde content and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but lower activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), as well as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Furthermore, the expression of multiple stress-related genes, which are associated with ROS-homeostasis (<i>NtSOD</i> and <i>NtPOD</i>), pathogen challenge (<i>NtPAL</i>), and pathogen맋efense (<i>NtPR1</i>, <i>NtNPR1</i>, and <i>NtPDF1.2</i>) were altered in the <i>CoWRKY78</i>-overexpressing plants. These findings increase our understanding of the <i>CoWRKY</i> genes and lay the foundation for the exploration of anthracnose resistance mechanisms and expedite the breeding of마nthracnose-resistant <i>C. oleifera</i> cultivars.
