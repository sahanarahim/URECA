['20053798', 'Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens. It  has been shown that several defense responses are influenced by light, and the  red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochromes (PHY) modulate plant defense  responses in Arabidopsis. Blue light receptor cryptochromes (CRY) work together  with PHY to regulate many light-controlled responses, including  photomorphogenesis, floral induction, and entrainment of the circadian clock. We  report here that the Arabidopsis blue light photoreceptor CRY1 positively  regulates inducible resistance to Pseudomonas syringae under continuous light  conditions. By challenging plants with P. syringae pv. tomato (Pst.) DC3000  carrying avrRpt2, we demonstrate that effector-triggered local resistance is  down-regulated in the cry1 mutant, leading to more pathogen multiplication. In  plants overexpressing CRY1 (CRY1-ovx), however, local resistance is significantly  up-regulated. We also show that systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is positively  regulated by CRY1, and that salicylic acid (SA)-induced pathogenesis-related gene  PR-1 expression is reduced in the cry1 mutant, but enhanced in CRY1-ovx plants.  However, our results indicate that CRY1 only modestly influences SA accumulation  and has no effect on hypersensitive cell death. These results suggest that CRY1  may positively regulate R protein-mediated resistance to P. syringae with  increased PR gene expression.', '2010 May', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssp107', 'Yang']
