Phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces anthocyanin biosynthesis; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is less known. In this study, we found that the apple MYB transcription factor MdMYB1 activated anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to ABA. Using a yeast screening technique, we isolated MdbZIP44, an ABA-induced bZIP transcription factor in apple, as a co-partner with MdMYB1. MdbZIP44 promoted anthocyanin accumulation in response to ABA by enhancing the binding of MdMYB1 to the promoters of downstream target genes. Furthermore, we identified MdBT2, a BTB protein, as an MdbZIP44-interacting protein. A series of molecular, biochemical, and genetic analysis suggested that MdBT2 degraded MdbZIP44 protein through the Ubiquitin-26S proteasome system, thus inhibiting MdbZIP44-modulated anthocyanin biosynthesis. Taken together, we reveal a novel working mechanism of MdbZIP44-mediated anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to ABA.
