Sucrose phosphate synthases (SPSs) are rate-limiting sucrose synthesis enzymes present in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. The cucumber genome contains three SPSs that can be grouped into families A, B, and C. CsSPS1 and CsSPS2 are highly expressed in flowers and mature leaves, while the expression level of CsSPS4 increased gradually after leaf unfolding in our study and reached its peak after 20 days. In CsSPS4-overexpression tobacco plants, sucrose content and sucrose/starch ratio were increased significantly and resulted in improved leaf yield. By contrast, in CsSPS4-overexpression (CsSPS4-OE) cucumber lines, contents of sucrose and starch were unchanged, and raffinose was increased in transgenic cucumber leaves. The expression of cucumber raffinose family oligosaccharide (RFO)-synthesis-related genes increased obviously in cucumber CsSPS4-OE plants, and the sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose contents increased significantly in the petioles of CsSPS4-OE lines. In CsSPS4-antisense (CsSPS4-A) cucumber lines, decreases occurred in mRNA expression, enzyme activity, sucrose content, sucrose/starch ratio, and stachyose transport, but the RFO-synthesis-related genes were nearly unchanged. Together, these results suggest that overexpression of CsSPS4 can lead to carbon metabolism prioritizing sugar transport in cucumber, and suppression of CsSPS4 likely promotes carbon metabolism to accumulate starch, showing a more complicated carbon distribution model than in transgenic tobacco plants.

CsSPS4: !overexpression! increases sucrose content and sucrose/starch ratio
CsSPS4: !overexpression! increases raffinose content
CsSPS4: !overexpression! increases expression of RFO-synthesis-related genes
CsSPS4: !antisense! decreases mRNA expression, enzyme activity, sucrose content, sucrose/starch ratio, and stachyose transport
