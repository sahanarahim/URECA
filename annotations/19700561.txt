['19700561', 'Human CGI-58 (for comparative gene identification-58) and YLR099c, encoding Ict1p  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have recently been identified as acyl-CoA-dependent  lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases. Sequence database searches for CGI-58  like proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) revealed 24 proteins with  At4g24160, a member of the alpha/beta-hydrolase family of proteins being the  closest homolog. At4g24160 contains three motifs that are conserved across the  plant species: a GXSXG lipase motif, a HX(4)D acyltransferase motif, and  V(X)(3)HGF, a probable lipid binding motif. Dendrogram analysis of yeast ICT1,  CGI-58, and At4g24160 placed these three polypeptides in the same group. Here, we  describe and characterize At4g24160 as, to our knowledge, the first soluble  lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase in plants. A lipidomics approach revealed  that At4g24160 has additional triacylglycerol lipase and phosphatidylcholine  hydrolyzing enzymatic activities. These data establish At4g24160, a protein with  a previously unknown function, as an enzyme that might play a pivotal role in  maintaining the lipid homeostasis in plants by regulating both phospholipid and  neutral lipid levels.', '2009 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.144261', 'Rajasekharan']
