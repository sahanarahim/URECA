Petals appear in many angiosperm taxa, yet when and how these attractive organs originated remains unclear. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on morphological data suggest that petals have evolved multiple times during the radiation of the angiosperms. Based on the diversity of petal morphologies, it is likely that the developmental programmes specifying petal identity are distinct in different lineages. On the other hand, molecular genetic analyses have suggested that the specification of petal identity in different lineages utilizes similar genetic pathways. Together, these observations indicate that the evolution of petals has relied on the repeated recruitment of a suite of interacting developmental control genes, albeit in different ways in different lineages. These observations suggest that this gene regulatory network represents a 'deep homology' in plant evolution. A major challenge is to understand how this ancestral developmental pathway has been redeployed in different angiosperm lineages, and how changes in the workings of this pathway have led to the myriad shapes, colours, and sizes of petals.
