The role of the hexokinases (HXKs) as glucose (Glc) sensors has been mainly demonstrated for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) HXK1 (AtHXK1) but has yet to be shown in other plant species. In our recent publication, we reported that two rice (Oryza sativa) HXKs, OsHXK5 and OsHXK6, also function as Glc sensors. These two enzymes harbor both mitochondrial targeting peptides (mTPs) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs), and we confirmed their dual-targeting ability to nuclei and mitochondria using GFP fusion experiments. Consistently, it has been previously known that AtHXK1 is predominantly associated with mitochondria but is also present in nuclei in vivo at appreciable levels. Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their catalytically inactive mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2 (gin2) mutant. In addition, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the Rubisco small subunit (RbcS) gene in response to glucose treatment. Our results thus provided evidence that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 can function as glucose sensors in rice. Hence, the available current data suggest that the role of the HXKs as Glc sensors may be conserved in both monocot and dicot plant species, and that the nuclear localization of AtHXK1, OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 may be critical for Glc sensing and signaling.
