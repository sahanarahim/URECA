['12215508', 'The plant genes required for the growth and reproduction of plant pathogens are  largely unknown. In an effort to identify these genes, we isolated Arabidopsis  mutants that do not support the normal growth of the powdery mildew pathogen  Erysiphe cichoracearum. Here, we report on the cloning and characterization of  one of these genes, PMR6. PMR6 encodes a pectate lyase-like protein with a novel  C-terminal domain. Consistent with its predicted gene function, mutations in PMR6  alter the composition of the plant cell wall, as shown by Fourier transform  infrared spectroscopy. pmr6-mediated resistance requires neither salicylic acid  nor the ability to perceive jasmonic acid or ethylene, indicating that the  resistance mechanism does not require the activation of well-described defense  pathways. Thus, pmr6 resistance represents a novel form of disease resistance  based on the loss of a gene required during a compatible interaction rather than  the activation of known host defense pathways.', '2002 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.003509', 'Somerville']
