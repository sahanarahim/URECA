Extensins are cell wall glycoproteins, belonging to the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) family, which are involved in many biological functions, including plant growth and defence. Several reviews have described the involvement of HRGPs in plant immunity but little focus has been given specifically to cell wall extensins. Yet, a large set of recently published data indicates that extensins play an important role in plant protection, especially in root-microbe interactions. Here, we summarise the current knowledge on this topic and discuss the importance of extensins in root defence. We first provide an overview of the distribution of extensin epitopes recognised by different monoclonal antibodies among plants and discuss the relevance of some of these epitopes as markers of the root defence response. We also highlight the implication of extensins in different types of plant interactions elicited by either pathogenic or beneficial micro-organisms. We then present and discuss the specific importance of extensins in root secretions, as these glycoproteins are not only found in the cell walls but are also released into the root mucilage. Finally, we propose a model to illustrate the impact of cell wall extensin on root secretions.
