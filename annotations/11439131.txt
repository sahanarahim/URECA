['11439131', 'To investigate the signaling pathways through which defense responses are  activated following pathogen infection, we have isolated and characterized the  cpr22 mutant. This plant carries a semidominant, conditional lethal mutation that  confers constitutive expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PR-1,  PR-2, PR-5 and the defensin gene PDF1.2. cpr22 plants also display spontaneous  lesion formation, elevated levels of salicylic acid (SA) and heightened  resistance to Peronospora parasitica Emco5. The cpr22 locus was mapped to  chromosome 2, approximately 2 cM telomeric to the AthB102 marker. By analyzing  the progeny of crosses between cpr22 plants and either NahG transgenic plants or  npr1 mutants, all of the cpr22-associated phenotypes except PDF1.2 expression  were found to be SA dependent. However, the SA signal transducer NPR1 was  required only for constitutive PR-1 expression. A cross between cpr22 and ndr1-1  mutants revealed that enhanced resistance to P. parasitica is mediated by an  NDR1-dependent pathway, while the other cpr22-induced defenses are not. Crosses  between either coi1-1 or etr1-1 mutants further demonstrated that constitutive  PDF1.2 expression is mediated by a JA- and ethylene-dependent pathway. Based on  these results, the cpr22 mutation appears to induce its associated phenotypes by  activating NPR1-dependent and NPR1-independent branches of the SA pathway, as  well as an ethylene/JA signaling pathway. Interestingly, the SA-dependent  phenotypes, but not the SA-independent phenotypes, are suppressed when cpr22  mutants are grown under high humidity.', '2001 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.2641039.x', 'Klessig']
