['21772271', 'Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is a small polypeptide that modulates  protein activity and regulates hormone signalling, abiotic and biotic responses  in plants. Here we show that AtSIZ regulates nitrogen assimilation in Arabidopsis  through its E3 SUMO ligase function. Dwarf plants of siz1-2 flower early, show  abnormal seed development and have high salicylic acid content and enhanced  resistance to bacterial pathogens. These mutant phenotypes are reverted to  wild-type phenotypes by exogenous ammonium but not by nitrate, phosphate or  potassium. Decreased nitrate reductase activity in siz1-2 plants resulted in low  nitrogen concentrations, low nitric oxide production and high nitrate content in  comparison with wild-type plants. The nitrate reductases, NIA1 and NIA2, are  sumoylated by AtSIZ1, which dramatically increases their activity. Both  sumoylated and non-sumoylated NIA1 and NIA2 can form dimers. Our results indicate  that AtSIZ1 positively controls nitrogen assimilation by promoting sumoylation of  NRs in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Jul 19', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms1408', 'Seo']
