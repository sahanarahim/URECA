The activation of the CAChi2 promoter as the result of bacterial infection and osmotic stresses was examined using the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assay. Several stress-related cis-acting elements were revealed within the upstream genomic sequence of the CAChi2 gene. In tobacco leaf tissues transiently transformed with the CAChi2 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene, the CAChi2 promoter was up-regulated by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci infection. The CAChi2-GUS activation was closely related to osmotic stresses, including treatment with mannitol and NaCl. The -378 CAChi2 promoter was sufficient for the CAChi2 gene induction by salicylic acid treatment. CAChi2 overexpression in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants enhanced bacterial disease resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato infection. CAChi2-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants also exhibited increased tolerance to NaCl-induced osmotic stresses during seed germination and seedling growth. CAChi2 overexpression induced the expression of the NaCl stress-responsive gene RD29A in the absence of NaCl stress. The CAChi2-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited increased sensitivity to abscisic acid during seed germination.
