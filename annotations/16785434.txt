['16785434', 'Innate immunity is initiated in animals and plants through the recognition of a  variety of pathogen-associated molecules that in animals are called  pathogen-associated molecular patterns and in plants are called elicitors. Some  plant pathogen-derived elicitors have been identified as peptides, but peptide  elicitors derived from the plant itself that activate defensive genes against  pathogens have not been previously identified. Here, we report the isolation and  characterization of a 23-aa peptide from Arabidopsis, called AtPep1, which  activates transcription of the defensive gene defensin (PDF1.2) and activates the  synthesis of H(2)O(2), both being components of the innate immune response. The  peptide is derived from a 92-aa precursor encoded within a small gene that is  inducible by wounding, methyl jasmonate, and ethylene. Constitutive expression of  the AtPep1 precursor gene PROPEP1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants causes a  constitutive transcription of PDF1.2. When grown in soil, the transgenic plants  exhibited an increased root development compared with WT plants and an enhanced  resistance toward the root pathogen Pythium irregulare. Six paralogs of PROPEP1  are present in Arabidopsis, and orthologs have been identified in species of  several agriculturally important plant families, where they are of interest for  their possible use in crop improvement.', '2006 Jun 27', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0603727103', 'Ryan']
