['19222996', 'Plant cells often use cell surface receptors to sense environmental changes and  then transduce external signals via activated signaling pathways to trigger  adaptive responses. In Arabidopsis, the receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) gene  family contains more than 600 members, and some of these are induced by pathogen  infection, suggesting a possible role in plant defense responses. We previously  characterized an S-locus RLK (CBRLK1) at the biochemical level. In this study, we  examined the physiological function of CBRLK1 in defense responses. CBRLK1 mutant  and CBRLK1-overexpressing transgenic plants showed enhanced and reduced  resistance against a virulent bacterial pathogen, respectively. The altered  pathogen resistances of the mutant and overexpressing transgenic plants were  associated with increased and reduced induction of the pathogenesis-related gene  PR1, respectively. These results suggest that CBRLK1 plays a negative role in the  disease resistance signaling pathway in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Apr 10', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.02.050', 'Chung']
