['26038230', 'The ERF (ethylene responsive factor) family is composed of transcription factors  (TFs) that are critical for appropriate Arabidopsis thaliana responses to biotic  and abiotic stresses. Here we identified and characterized a member of the ERF TF  group IX, namely ERF96, that when overexpressed enhances Arabidopsis resistance  to necrotrophic pathogens such as the fungus Botrytis cinerea and the bacterium  Pectobacterium carotovorum. ERF96 is jasmonate (JA) and ethylene (ET) responsive  and ERF96 transcripts accumulation was abolished in JA-insensitive coi1-16 and in  ET-insensitive ein2-1 mutants. Protoplast transactivation and electrophoresis  mobility shift analyses revealed that ERF96 is an activator of transcription that  binds to GCC elements. In addition, ERF96 mainly localized to the nucleus.  Microarray analysis coupled to chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR of Arabidopsis  overexpressing ERF96 revealed that ERF96 enhances the expression of the JA/ET  defence genes PDF1.2a, PR-3 and PR-4 as well as the TF ORA59 by direct binding to  GCC elements present in their promoters. While ERF96-RNAi plants demonstrated  wild-type resistance to necrotrophic pathogens, basal PDF1.2 expression levels  were reduced in ERF96-silenced plants. This work revealed ERF96 as a key player  of the ERF network that positively regulates the Arabidopsis resistance response  to necrotrophic pathogens.', '2015 Dec', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12583', 'Zimmerli']
