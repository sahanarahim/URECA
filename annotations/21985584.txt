This work investigated the contribution of AtRbohD and AtRbohF to regulating defence-associated metabolism during three types of interaction: (i) incompatible and (ii) compatible interaction with Pseudomonas syringae; and (iii) intracellular oxidative stress in the catalase-deficient cat2 background. In all three cases, loss of function of either gene modulated the response of defence compounds. AtRbohF gene function was necessary for rapid and full induction of salicylic acid (SA) during compatible and incompatible interactions, and for resistance to virulent bacteria. Both artrboh mutations modulated the effects of intracellular ROS in the cat2 background, although the predominant effect was mediated by atrbohF. Loss of this gene function increased lesion formation in cat2 but uncoupled this effect from cat2-triggered induction of SA and camalexin, accumulation of glutathione and disease resistance, all of which were much lower in cat2 artbohF than in cat2. A detailed comparison of GC-TOF-MS profiles produced by the three interactions revealed considerable overlap between cat2 effects and those produced by bacterial infection in the wild-type background. Analysis of the impact of the two atrboh mutations on these profiles provided further evidence that AtRbohF interacts closely with intracellular oxidative stress to tune dynamic metabolic responses during infection. Thus, AtRbohF appears to be a key player not only in HR-related cell death but also in regulating metabolomic responses and resistance. Based on the results obtained during the three types of interaction, a model is proposed of how NADPH oxidases and intracellular ROS interact to determine the outcome of pathogen defence responses.
