The constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter (CaMV 35S) is widely used as a tool to express recombinant proteins in plants, but with different success. We previously showed that the expression of an F-actin marker, GFP-talin, in Physcomitrella patens using the CaMV 35S promoter failed to homogenously label moss tissues. Here, we show a significant diminution of the GFP fluorescence in dark grown old moss cells and complete lack of labelling in newly differentiated cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stable moss lines harbouring a resistance cassette driven by the CaMV 35S are unable to grow in darkness in the presence of the antibiotic. In contrast to the CaMV 35S, the heat inducible promoter, hsp17.3B showed uniform expression pattern in all cells and tissues following a mild heat shock.
