Light harvested by plants is essential for the survival of most life forms. This light perception ability requires the activities of proteins termed photoreceptors. We report a function for photoreceptors in mediating resistance (R) protein-derived plant defense. The blue-light photoreceptors, cryptochrome (CRY) 2 and phototropin (PHOT) 2, are required for the stability of the R protein HRT, and thereby resistance to Turnip Crinkle virus (TCV). Exposure to darkness or blue-light induces degradation of CRY2, and in turn HRT, resulting in susceptibility. Overexpression of HRT can compensate for the absence of PHOT2 but not CRY2. HRT does not directly associate with either CRY2 or PHOT2 but does bind the CRY2-/PHOT2-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase, COP1. Application of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, prevents blue-light-dependent degradation of HRT, consequently these plants show resistance to TCV under blue-light. We propose that CRY2/PHOT2 negatively regulate the proteasome-mediated degradation of HRT, likely via COP1, and blue-light relieves this repression resulting in HRT degradation.

Light: !activates! photoreceptors 
photoreceptors: !regulate! HRT 
CRY2/PHOT2: !interact with! COP1 
COP1: !mediates! proteasome-mediated degradation of HRT 
blue-light: !relieves! repression of HRT
