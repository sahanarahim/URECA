['22381007', 'To cope with a lifetime of exposure to a variety of pathogens, plants have  developed exquisite and refined defense mechanisms that vary depending on the  type of attacking pathogen. Defense-associated transcriptional reprogramming is a  central part of plant defense mechanisms. Chromatin modification has recently  been shown to be another layer of regulation for plant defense mechanisms. Here,  we show that the RPD3/HDA1-class histone deacetylase HDA19 is involved in the  repression of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense responses in Arabidopsis. Loss  of HDA19 activity increased SA content and increased the expression of a group of  genes required for accumulation of SA as well as pathogenesis related (PR) genes,  resulting in enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. We found that HDA19  directly associates with and deacetylates histones at the PR1 and PR2 promoters.  Thus, our study shows that HDA19, by modifying chromatin to a repressive state,  ensures low basal expression of defense genes, such as PR1, under unchallenged  conditions, as well as their proper induction without overstimulation during  defense responses to pathogen attacks. Thus, the role of HDA19 might be critical  in preventing unnecessary activation and self-destructive overstimulation of  defense responses, allowing successful growth and development.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04977.x', 'Noh']
