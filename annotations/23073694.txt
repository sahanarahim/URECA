['23073694', 'Systemic resistance induced in plants by nonpathogenic rhizobacteria is typically  effective against multiple pathogens. Here, we show that root-colonizing  Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SS101 (Pf.SS101) enhanced resistance in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) against several bacterial pathogens, including  Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) and the insect pest Spodoptera exigua.  Transcriptomic analysis and bioassays with specific Arabidopsis mutants revealed  that, unlike many other rhizobacteria, the Pf.SS101-induced resistance response  to Pst is dependent on salicylic acid signaling and not on jasmonic acid and  ethylene signaling. Genome-wide transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomic  analyses showed that in roots and leaves of Arabidopsis plants treated with  Pf.SS101, approximately 1,910 genes and 50 metabolites were differentially  regulated relative to untreated plants. Integration of both sets of "omics" data  pointed to a prominent role of camalexin and glucosinolates in the  Pf.SS101-induced resistance response. Subsequent bioassays with seven Arabidopsis  mutants (myb51, cyp79B2cyp79B3, cyp81F2, pen2, cyp71A12, cyp71A13, and  myb28myb29) disrupted in the biosynthesis pathways for these plant secondary  metabolites showed that camalexin and glucosinolates are indeed required for the  induction of Pst resistance by Pf.SS101. Also for the insect S. exigua, the  indolic glucosinolates appeared to play a role in the Pf.SS101-induced resistance  response. This study provides, to our knowledge for the first time, insight into  the substantial biochemical and temporal transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis  associated with the salicylic acid-dependent resistance response induced by  specific rhizobacteria.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.207324', 'Raaijmakers']
