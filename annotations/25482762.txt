Salicylic acid (SA) has a central role in activating plant resistance to pathogens. SA levels increase in plant tissue following pathogen infection and exogenous SA enhances resistance to a broad range of pathogens. To study the relevance of the SA signaling in the flg22 response, we investigated the responses of SA-related mutants to flg22, a 22-amino acid peptide of the flagellin bacterial protein. We identified SA as an important component of the flg22-triggered oxidative burst, a very early event after flg22 detection, and gene induction, an early event. SA acted partially by enhancing accumulation of FLS2 mRNA. We also provide new evidence that NPR1 play a role in SA-induced priming event that enhances the flg22-triggered oxidative burst, which is correlated with enhancement of the flg22-induced callose deposition. Based on these observations, we conclude that SA signaling is required for early as well as late flg22 responses.
