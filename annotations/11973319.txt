['11973319', 'To identify Arabidopsis mutants that constitutively express systemic acquired  resistance (SAR), we constructed reporter lines expressing the firefly luciferase  gene under the control of the SAR-inducible PR-1 promoter (PR-1/luc). After EMS  mutagenesis of a well-characterized transgenic line, we screened 250,000 M(2)  plants for constitutive expression of the reporter gene in vivo. From a mutant  collection containing several hundred putative mutants, we concentrated on 16  mutants lacking spontaneous hypersensitive response (HR) cell death. We mapped 4  of these constitutive immunity (cim) mutants to chromosome arms. Constitutive  expression of disease resistance was established by analyzing responses to  virulent Peronospora parasitica and Pseudomonas syringae strains, by RNA blot  analysis for endogenous marker genes, and by determination of salicylic acid  levels in the mutants. The variety of the cim phenotypes allowed us to define  distinct steps in both the canonical SAR signaling pathway and a separate pathway  for resistance to Erysiphe cichoracearum, active in only a subset of the mutants.', '2002 Apr', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/160.4.1661', 'Ryals']
