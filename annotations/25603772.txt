['25603772', 'BACKGROUND: The increased selection pressure of the herbicide glyphosate has  played a role in the evolution of glyphosate-resistance in weedy species, an  issue that is becoming a threat to global agriculture. The molecular components  involved in the cellular toxicity response to this herbicide at the expression  level are still unidentified. RESULTS: In this study, we identify the protein  kinase GCN2 as a cellular component that fosters the action of glyphosate in the  model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Comparative studies using wild-type and gcn2  knock-out mutant seedlings show that the molecular programme that the plant  deploys after the treatment with the herbicide, is compromised in gcn2. Moreover,  gcn2 adult plants show a lower inhibition of photosynthesis, and both seedlings  and adult gcn2 plants accumulate less shikimic acid than wild-type after  treatment with glyphosate. CONCLUSIONS: These results points to an unknown  GCN2-dependent factor involved in the cascade of events triggered by glyphosate  in plants. Data suggest either that the herbicide does not equally reach the  target-enzyme in a gcn2 background, or that a decreased flux in the shikimate  pathway in a gcn2 plants minimize the impact of enzyme inhibition.', '2015 Jan 21', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-014-0378-0', 'Gadea']
