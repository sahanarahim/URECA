Plant viruses are composed of diverse genomes (e.g., RNA or DNA) encoding proteins that vary widely in sequence. It is becoming clear, however, that some apparently unrelated viral proteins have similar functions. The P6 protein encoded by Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and the 126-kDa protein encoded by Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are examples of this convergence in protein function. Although having no apparent sequence similarity, both proteins are pathogenicity determinants during infection, are components of novel intracellular cytoplasmic inclusions and suppress RNA silencing. Here we review our recent results demonstrating an additional novel convergent activity between these proteins: both proteins traffic along the actin cytoskeleton (microfilaments). We also discuss results showing a unique property of the P6 protein: a non-mobile strong association with microtubules. Lastly, we discuss the potential mechanism by which the P6 and 126-kDa proteins traffic along microfilaments. We provide new results suggesting that actin filament polymerization-driven movement does not support 126-kDa protein transport, thus leading to a focus on myosins as the driving force for this movement.
