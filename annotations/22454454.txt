['22454454', 'Plant defense responses to pathogens are influenced by abiotic factors, including  temperature. Elevated temperatures often inhibit the activities of disease  resistance proteins and the defense responses they mediate. A mutant screen with  an Arabidopsis thaliana temperature-sensitive autoimmune mutant bonzai1 revealed  that the abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient mutant aba2 enhances resistance mediated  by the resistance (R) gene suppressor of npr1-1 constitutive1 (SNC1) at high  temperature. ABA deficiency promoted nuclear accumulation of SNC1, which was  essential for it to function at low and high temperatures. Furthermore, the  effect of ABA deficiency on SNC1 protein accumulation is independent of salicylic  acid, whose effects are often antagonized by ABA. ABA deficiency also promotes  the activity and nuclear localization of R protein resistance to Pseudomonas  syringae4 at higher temperature, suggesting that the effect of ABA on R protein  localization and nuclear activity is rather broad. By contrast, mutations that  confer ABA insensitivity did not promote defense responses at high temperature,  suggesting either tissue specificity of ABA signaling or a role of ABA in defense  regulation independent of the core ABA signaling machinery. Taken together, this  study reveals a new intersection between ABA and disease resistance through R  protein localization and provides further evidence of antagonism between abiotic  and biotic responses.', '2012 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.096198', 'Hua']
