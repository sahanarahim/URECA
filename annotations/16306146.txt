['16306146', 'The genome sequencing of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has revealed that  secondary metabolism plant glycosyltransferases (UGTs) are encoded by an  unexpectedly large multigenic family of 120 members. Very little is known about  their actual function in planta, in particular during plant pathogen  interactions. Among them, members of the group D are of particular interest since  they are related to UGTs involved in stress-inducible responses in other plant  species. We provide here a detailed analysis of the expression profiles of this  group of Arabidopsis UGTs following infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  or after treatment with salicylic acid, methyljasmonate, and hydrogen peroxide.  Members of the group D displayed distinct induction profiles, indicating  potential roles in stress or defense responses notably for UGT73B3 and UGT73B5.  Analysis of UGT expression in Arabidopsis defense-signaling mutants further  revealed that their induction is methyljasmonate independent, but partially  salicylic acid dependent. T-DNA tagged mutants (ugt73b3 and ugt73b5) exhibited  decreased resistance to P. syringae pv tomato-AvrRpm1, indicating that expression  of the corresponding UGT genes is necessary during the hypersensitive response.  These results emphasize the importance of plant secondary metabolite UGTs in  plant-pathogen interactions and provide foundation for future understanding of  the exact role of UGTs during the hypersensitive response.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.067223', 'Saindrenan']
