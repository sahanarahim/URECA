['10662863', 'The Arabidopsis NPR1 gene is essential in activating systemic, inducible plant  defense responses. To gain a better understanding of NPR1 function, we conducted  a yeast two-hybrid screening procedure and identified a differential interaction  between NPR1 and all known members of the Arabidopsis TGA family of basic leucine  zipper transcription factors. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, NPR1  substantially increased the binding of TGA2 to its cognate promoter element  (as-1) as well as to a positive salicylic acid-inducible element (LS7) and a  negative element (LS5) in the promoter of the pathogenesis-related PR-1 gene.  Proteins encoded by npr1 mutants interacted poorly with TGA2 and did not  substantially increase TGA2 binding to the as-1, LS5, or LS7 elements, thus  establishing a link between the loss of disease resistance and the loss of TGA2  interaction and NPR1-enhanced DNA binding. Coupled with observations that the DNA  binding activity of TGA factors is deregulated in npr1 plants, the results  suggest that NPR1-mediated DNA binding of TGA2 is critical for activation of  defense genes.', '2000 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '99-0347', 'Fobert']
