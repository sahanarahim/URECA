['17644729', 'Epidermis cell differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana is a model system for  understanding the developmental end state of plant cells. Two types of MYB  transcription factors, R2R3-MYB and R3-MYB, are involved in cell fate  determination. To examine the molecular basis of this process, we analyzed the  functional relationship of the R2R3-type MYB gene WEREWOLF (WER) and the R3-type  MYB gene CAPRICE (CPC). Chimeric constructs made from the R3 MYB regions of WER  and CPC used in reciprocal complementation experiments showed that the CPC R3  region cannot functionally substitute for the WER R3 region in the  differentiation of hairless cells. However, WER R3 can substantially substitute  for CPC R3. There are no differences in yeast interaction assays of WER or WER  chimera proteins with GLABRA3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3). CPC and CPC  chimera proteins also have similar activity in preventing GL3 WER and EGL3 WER  interactions. Furthermore, we showed by gel mobility shift assays that WER  chimera proteins do not bind to the GL2 promoter region. However, a CPC chimera  protein, which harbors the WER R3 motif, still binds to the GL2 promoter region.', '2007 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.045732', 'Wada']
