['21030507', 'Signaling induced upon a reduction in oleic acid (18:1) levels simultaneously  up-regulates salicylic acid (SA)-mediated responses and inhibits jasmonic acid  (JA)-inducible defenses, resulting in enhanced resistance to biotrophs but  increased susceptibility to necrotrophs. SA and the signaling component Enhanced  Disease Susceptibility1 function redundantly in this low-18:1-derived pathway to  induce SA signaling but do not function in the repression of JA responses. We  show that repression of JA-mediated signaling under low-18:1 conditions is  mediated via the WRKY50 and WRKY51 proteins. Knockout mutations in WRKY50 and  WRKY51 lowered SA levels but did not restore pathogenesis-related gene expression  or pathogen resistance to basal levels in the low-18:1-containing Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant, suppressor of SA insensitivity2 (ssi2). In  contrast, both JA-inducible PDF1.2 (defensin) expression and basal resistance to  Botrytis cinerea were restored. Simultaneous mutations in both WRKY genes (ssi2  wrky50 wrky51) did not further enhance the JA or Botrytis-related responses. The  ssi2 wrky50 and ssi2 wrky51 plants contained high levels of reactive oxygen  species and exhibited enhanced cell death, the same as ssi2 plants. This  suggested that high reactive oxygen species levels or increased cell death were  not responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of ssi2 plants to B. cinerea.  Exogenous SA inhibited JA-inducible PDF1.2 expression in the wild type but not in  wrky50 or wrky51 mutant plants. These results show that the WRKY50 and WRKY51  proteins mediate both SA- and low-18:1-dependent repression of JA signaling.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.166876', 'Kachroo']
