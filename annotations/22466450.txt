['22466450', 'Calmodulin-binding proteins (CBPs) have been known to be involved in both biotic  and abiotic stress responses. Recently, two closely related CBPs, Arabidopsis SAR  Deficient 1 and CBP60g, were found to belong to a new family of transcription  factors that regulate salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis triggered by  microbe-associated molecular patterns. In this study, we found that  overexpression of CBP60g in Arabidopsis caused elevated SA accumulation,  increased expression of the defense genes, and enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas  syringae. In addition to the enhanced defense response, the CBP60g overexpression  lines showed hypersensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and enhanced tolerance to  drought stress. We also found that treatment with ABA and drought stress leads to  a higher expression level of the ICS1 gene, which encodes isochorismate synthase,  in the CBP60g overexpression lines than in the wild-type control plants. Our  results suggest that CBP60g serves as a molecular link that positively regulates  ABA- and SA-mediated pathways in plants. KEY MESSAGE: Overexpression of CBP60g in  Arabidopsis enhanced the defense response, hypersensitivity to abscisic acid and  tolerance to drought stress.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-012-1247-7', 'Li']
