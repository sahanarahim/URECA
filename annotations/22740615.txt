['22740615', 'Plants utilize a large number of immune receptors to recognize pathogens and  activate defense responses. A small number of these receptors belong to the  receptor-like protein family. Previously, we showed that a gain-of-function  mutation in the receptor-like protein SNC2 (for Suppressor of NPR1,  Constitutive2) leads to constitutive activation of defense responses in snc2-1D  mutant plants. To identify defense signaling components downstream of SNC2, we  carried out a suppressor screen in the snc2-1D mutant background of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Map-based cloning of one of the suppressor genes, BDA1  (for bian da; "becoming big" in Chinese), showed that it encodes a protein with  amino-terminal ankyrin repeats and carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domains.  Loss-of-function mutations in BDA1 suppress the dwarf morphology and constitutive  defense responses in snc2-1D npr1-1 (for nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related  genes1,1) and also result in enhanced susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. In  contrast, a gain-of-function allele of bda1 isolated from a separate genetic  screen to search for mutants with enhanced pathogen resistance was found to  constitutively activate cell death and defense responses. These data suggest that  BDA1 is a critical signaling component that functions downstream of SNC2 to  regulate plant immunity.', '2012 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.197152', 'Zhang']
