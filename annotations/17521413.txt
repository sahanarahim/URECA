['17521413', 'In Arabidopsis, the GH3-like gene family consists of 19 members, several of which  have been shown to adenylate the plant hormones jasmonic acid, indole acetic acid  and salicylic acid (SA). In some cases, this adenylation has been shown to  catalyze hormone conjugation to amino acids. Here we report molecular  characterization of the GH3-LIKE DEFENSE GENE 1 (GDG1), a member of the GH3-like  gene family, and show that GDG1 is an important component of SA-mediated defense  against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of GDG1 is  induced earlier and to a higher level in response to avirulent pathogens compared  to virulent pathogens. gdg1 null mutants are compromised in several pathogen  defense responses, including activation of defense genes and resistance against  virulent and avirulent bacterial pathogens. Accumulation of free and  glucoside-conjugated SA (SAG) in response to pathogen infection is compromised in  gdg1 mutants. All defense-related phenotypes of gdg1 can be rescued by external  application of SA, suggesting that gdg1 mutants are defective in the SA-mediated  defense pathway(s) and that GDG1 functions upstream of SA. Our results suggest  that GDG1 contributes to both basal and resistance gene-mediated inducible  defenses against P. syringae (and possibly other pathogens) by playing a critical  role in regulating the levels of pathogen-inducible SA. GDG1 is allelic to the  PBS3 (avrPphB susceptible) gene.', '2007 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03130.x', 'Raina']
