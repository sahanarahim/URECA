['21762165', 'Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) proteins comprise the most recently  identified family of multidrug transporters. In plants, the numbers of MATE  proteins has undergone a remarkable expansion, underscoring the importance of  these transporters within this kingdom. Here, we describe the identification and  characterization of Activated Disease Susceptibility 1 (ADS1) which encodes a  putative MATE transport protein. An activation tagging screen uncovered the  ads1-Dominant (ads1-D) mutant, which was subsequently characterized by molecular,  genetic and biochemical approaches. The ads1-D mutant was compromised in both  basal and nonhost resistance against microbial pathogens. Further, plant defence  responses conferred by RPS4 were also disabled in ads1-D plants. By contrast,  depletion of ADS1 transcripts by RNA-interference (RNAi) promoted basal disease  resistance. Unexpectedly, ads1-D plants were found to constitutively accumulate  reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). However, analysis of ads1-D Arabidopsis  thaliana respiratory burst oxidase (atrboh) double and triple mutants indicated  that an increase in ROIs did not impact ads1-D-mediated disease susceptibility.  Our findings imply that ADS1 negatively regulates the accumulation of the plant  immune activator salicylic acid (SA) and cognate Pathogenesis-Related 1 (PR1)  gene expression. Collectively, these data highlight an important role for MATE  proteins in the establishment of plant disease resistance.', '2011 Oct', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03820.x', 'Loake']
