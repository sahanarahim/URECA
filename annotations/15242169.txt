['15242169', 'When challenged with the crucifer pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum,  Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was colonized by the fungus within  2 to 3 days, developing brown necrotic lesions surrounded by a yellow halo.  Lesions spread from the inoculation site within 3 to 4 days, and subsequently  continued to expand until they covered the entire leaf. Electron microscopy  confirmed that C. higginsianum is a hemibiotroph on Arabidopsis, feeding  initially on living cells as a biotroph before switching to a necrotrophic mode  of growth. A collection of 37 ecotypes of Arabidopsis varied in their responses  to infection by C. higginsianum. The ecotype Eil-0 was highly resistant, with  symptoms limited to necrotic flecking and with only very limited fungal  colonization. Analyses suggested that the hypersensitive response and reactive  oxygen species may be important in this defense response. Expression analyses  with cDNA microarrays indicated that the defense reaction depends primarily on  the jasmonic acid- and ethylene-dependent signaling pathways and, to a lesser  extent, on the salicylate-dependent pathway. Crosses between the Eil-0 and Col-0  ecotypes suggested that the resistance in Eil-0 was dominant and was conferred by  a single locus, which we named RCH1. RCH1 is the first resistance locus to be  identified from Arabidopsis against the hemibiotrophic fungus genus  Colletotrichum.', '2004 Jul', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.7.749', 'Shinozaki']
