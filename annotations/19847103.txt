Metabolic changes that occur in host tissues during a necrotrophic plant/fungal interaction have been poorly investigated. Whereas carbon metabolism reprogramming and photosynthesis disturbances have been studied, data on plant amino acids stores during infection are scarce. Here we report an analysis of sunflower cotyledon amino acid content during infection with the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea, by using (13)C-NMR spectroscopy. A rapid disappearance of plant amino acids was observed, most probably due to fungal assimilation. In order to explore amino acid changes due to host reaction, we investigated the amino acid content in healthy and invaded region of infected leaves. During the course of infection, glutamate store was affected at distance in the non invaded region. Glutamate depletion was correlated to an enhanced sunflower glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) transcription level in the area invaded by pathogen. Our data suggest that glutamate could be transferred to the invaded region to supply nitrogen. Such a strategy could delay cell death, and consequently disturb fungal progression in plant tissues.

glutamate store: !depletes! in invaded region 
invaded region: !receives! glutamate from non-invaded region
