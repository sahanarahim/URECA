['15965251', 'Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes differ in their susceptibility to Fusarium wilt  diseases. Ecotype Taynuilt-0 (Ty-0) is susceptible to Fusarium oxysporum forma  specialis (f.) matthioli whereas Columbia-0 (Col-0) is resistant. Segregation  analysis of a cross between Ty-0 and Col-0 revealed six dominant RESISTANCE TO  FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM (RFO) loci that significantly contribute to f. matthioli  resistance in Col-0 relative to Ty-0. We refer to the locus with the strongest  effect as RFO1. Ty-0 plants in which only the Col-0 allele of RFO1 (RFO1(Col-0))  was introduced were resistant to f. matthioli. Surprisingly, RFO1(Col-0) also  conferred resistance to f. raphani, demonstrating that RFO1-mediated resistance  is not race specific. Expression of resistance by RFO2, RFO4, or RFO6 was  dependent on RFO1(Col-0). Map-based cloning of RFO1(Col-0) showed that RFO1 is  identical to the previously named Arabidopsis gene WAKL22 (WALL-ASSOCIATED  KINASE-LIKE KINASE 22), which encodes a receptor-like kinase that does not  contain an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain. Consistent with these  results, a Col-0 rfo1 loss-of-function mutant was more susceptible to f.  matthioli, f. conglutinans, and f. raphani. Thus, RFO1 encodes a novel type of  dominant disease-resistance protein that confers resistance to a broad spectrum  of Fusarium races.', '2005 Sep', 'Genetics', '10.1534/genetics.105.042218', 'Ausubel']
