['18776063', 'Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY38 and WRKY62, encoding two structurally similar type  III WRKY transcription factors, are induced in a Nonexpressor of PR Gene1  (NPR1)-dependent manner by salicylic acid (SA) or by virulent Pseudomonas  syringae. Disease resistance and SA-regulated Pathogenesis-Related1 (PR1) gene  expression are enhanced in the wrky38 and wrky62 single mutants and, to a greater  extent, in the double mutants. Overexpression of WRKY38 or WRKY62 reduces disease  resistance and PR1 expression. Thus, WRKY38 and WRKY62 function additively as  negative regulators of plant basal defense. WRKY38 and WRKY62 interact with  Histone Deacetylase 19 (HDA19). Expression of HDA19 is also induced by P.  syringae, and the stability of its induced transcripts depends on SA and NPR1 in  infected plants. Disruption of HDA19 leads to compromised resistance, whereas its  overexpression results in enhanced resistance to P. syringae. Thus, HDA19 has a  role opposite from those of WRKY38 and WRKY62 in basal resistance to the  bacterial pathogen. Both WRKY38 and WRKY62 are transcriptional activators in  plant cells, but their activation activities are abolished by overexpressed  HDA19. Interaction of WRKY38 and WRKY62 with HDA19 may act to fine-tune plant  basal defense responses.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.055566', 'Chen']
