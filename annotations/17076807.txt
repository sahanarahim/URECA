['17076807', 'NPR1 is required for systemic acquired resistance, and there are five NPR1  paralogs in Arabidopsis. Here we report knockout analysis of two of these, NPR3  and NPR4. npr3 single mutants have elevated basal PR-1 expression and the npr3  npr4 double mutant shows even higher expression. The double mutant plants also  display enhanced resistance against virulent bacterial and oomycete pathogens.  This enhanced disease resistance is partially dependent on NPR1, can be in part  complemented by either wild-type NPR3 or NPR4, and is not associated with an  elevated level of salicylic acid. NPR3 and NPR4 interact with TGA2, TGA3, TGA5  and TGA6 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Using bimolecular fluorescence  complementation analysis, we show that NPR3 interacts with TGA2 in the nucleus of  onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Combined with our  previous finding that basal PR-1 levels are also elevated in the tga2 tga5 tga6  triple mutant, we propose that NPR3 and NPR4 negatively regulate PR gene  expression and pathogen resistance through their association with TGA2 and its  paralogs.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02903.x', 'Li']
