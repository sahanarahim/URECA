Conspecific AMF strains can vary substantially at the genetic and phenotypic levels, leading to direct and quantifiable variation in plant growth. Recent studies have shown that high intraspecific diversity is very common in AMF, and not only found in model species. Studies have also revealed how the phenotype of conspecific isolates varies depending on the plant host, highlighting the functional relevance of intraspecific phenotypic plasticity for the AMF ecology and mycorrhizal symbiosis. Recent work has also demonstrated that conspecific isolates of the model AMF Rhizophagus irregularis harbor large and highly variable pangenomes, highlighting the potential role of intraspecific genome diversity for the ecological adaptation of these symbionts.
