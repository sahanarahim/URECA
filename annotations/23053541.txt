RING-finger proteins (RFP) function as ubiquitin ligases and play key roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little information is available on the regulation of RFP expression. Here, we isolate and characterize the RFP promoter sequence from the disease-resistant Chinese wild grape Vitis pseudoreticulata accession Baihe-35-1. Promoter-GUS fusion assays revealed that defense signaling molecules, powdery mildew infection, and heat stress induce VpRFP1 promoter activity. By contrast, the RFP1 promoter isolated from Vitis vinifera was only slightly induced by pathogen infection and heat treatment. By promoter deletion analysis, we found that the -148 bp region of the VpRFP1 promoter was the core functional promoter region. We also found that, in Arabidopsis, VpRFP1 expressed under its own promoter activated defense-related gene expression and improved disease resistance, but the same construct using the VvRFP1 promoter slightly improve disease resistance. Our results demonstrated that the -148 bp region of the VpRFP1 promoter plays a key role in response to pathogen and heat stress, and suggested that expression differences between VpRFP1 and VvRFP1 may be key for the differing disease resistance phenotypes of the two Vitis genotypes.
