['28760569', 'Jasmonates (JAs) orchestrate immune responses upon wound/herbivore injury or  infection by necrotrophic pathogens. Elucidation of catabolic routes has revealed  new complexity in jasmonate metabolism. Two integrated pathways attenuate  signaling by turning over the active hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile)  through omega-oxidation or deconjugation, and define an indirect route forming the  derivative 12OH-JA. Here, we provide evidence for a second 12OH-JA formation  pathway by direct jasmonic acid (JA) oxidation. Three jasmonic acid oxidases  (JAOs) of the 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase family catalyze specific oxidation of JA  to 12OH-JA, and their genes are induced by wounding or infection by the fungus  Botrytis cinerea. JAO2 exhibits the highest basal expression, and its deficiency  in jao2 mutants strongly enhanced antifungal resistance. The resistance phenotype  resulted from constitutive expression of antimicrobial markers rather than from  their higher induction in infected jao2 plants and could be reversed by ectopic  expression of any of the three JAOs in jao2. Elevated defense in jao2 was  dependent on the activity of JASMONATE RESPONSE 1 (JAR1) and  CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) but was not correlated with enhanced JA-Ile  accumulation. Instead, jao2 mutant lines displayed altered accumulation of  several JA species in healthy and challenged plants, suggesting elevated  metabolic flux through JA-Ile. Collectively, these data identify the missing  enzymes hydroxylating JA and uncover an important metabolic diversion mechanism  for repressing basal JA defense responses.', '2017 Sep 12', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2017.07.010', 'Heitz']
