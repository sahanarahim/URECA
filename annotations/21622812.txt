['21622812', 'Many plant host factors are known to interact with viral proteins during  pathogenesis, but how a plant virus induces a specific disease symptom still  needs further research. A lily strain of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV-HL) can  induce discrete necrotic spots on infected Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  plants; other CMV strains can induce similar spots, but they are not as distinct  as those induced by CMV-HL. The CMV 2b protein (2b), a known RNA-silencing  suppressor, is involved in viral movement and symptom induction. Using in situ  proximity ligation assay immunostaining and the protoplast assays, we report here  that CMV 2b interacts directly with Catalase3 (CAT3) in infected tissues, a key  enzyme in the breakdown of toxic hydrogen peroxide. Interestingly, CAT3, normally  localized in the cytoplasm (glyoxysome), was recruited to the nucleus by an  interaction between 2b and CAT3. Although overexpression of CAT3 in transgenic  plants decreased the accumulation of CMV and delayed viral symptom development to  some extent, 2b seems to neutralize the cellular catalase contributing to the  host defense response, thus favoring viral infection. Our results thus provide  evidence that, in addition to altering the type of symptom by disturbing microRNA  pathways, 2b can directly bind to a host factor that is important in scavenging  cellular hydrogen peroxide and thus interfere specifically with that host factor,  leading to the induction of a specific necrosis.', '2011 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.180042', 'Masuta']
