Induction of local defence, as well as systemic resistance, of plants is associated with transcriptional reprogramming. Here we report on defence gene induction by natural and synthetic stimulants of plant immunity. Gene expression changes in Arabidopsis thaliana were monitored in response to several plant immunity stimulants (plant activators) using Northern blotting and an application-based array representing c. 750 genes involved in several aspects of plant defence and/or plant stress. The commercial plant activators Bio-S, Neudo-Vital and PRORADIX have been shown to induce systemic resistance. Here, Neudo-Vital, PRORADIX and Bio-S treatment induced different patterns of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation. Gene induction by these plant activators proved to be very complex. Rather than simply mimicking one of the known defence pathways induced by SA or JA, the response to the plant activators showed aspects of both major defence systems. A general feature was the transient activation of JA biosynthesis genes, combined with a much more sustained SA-associated defence gene induction. Our results demonstrate that plant immunity stimulants activate systemic immunity at the transcriptional level, and they provide insight into the coordinated transcriptional regulation of several classes of plant defence genes.
