Pepper golden mosaic virus (PepGMV) and Pepper huasteco yellow vein virus (PHYVV), members of the Geminiviridae family, are important pathogens of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and other solanaceous crops. Accession BG-3821 of C. chinense Jacq. was reported earlier as resistant to mixed infection with PepGMV and PHYVV. In this work, we characterized the Geminivirus resistance trait present in BG-3821. Segregation analysis suggested that resistance depends on two genes. Our data showed that PepGMV replication in protoplast of resistant plants is approximately 70% lower when compared with the levels observed in protoplasts from susceptible plants. Additionally, viral movement is less efficient in resistant plants. We also evaluated several characteristics commonly associated with systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which is a conserved defensive mechanism. The concentration of salicylic acid was higher in resistant plants inoculated with PepGMV than in susceptible plants. Marker genes for SAR were induced after inoculation with PepGMV in resistant leaves. Similarly, we found a higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species on resistant leaves compared with susceptible ones. A model for the mechanism acting in the Geminivirus resistance detected in BG-3821 is proposed. Finally, the importance of BG-3821 in Geminivirus resistance breeding programs is discussed.
