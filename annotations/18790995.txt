Oligogalacturonides (OGs) are endogenous elicitors of defense responses released after partial degradation of pectin in the plant cell wall. We have previously shown that, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), OGs induce the expression of PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 (PAD3) and increase resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea independently of signaling pathways mediated by jasmonate, salicylic acid, and ethylene. Here, we illustrate that the rapid induction of the expression of a variety of genes by OGs is also independent of salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonate. OGs elicit a robust extracellular oxidative burst that is generated by the NADPH oxidase AtrbohD. This burst is not required for the expression of OG-responsive genes or for OG-induced resistance to B. cinerea, whereas callose accumulation requires a functional AtrbohD. OG-induced resistance to B. cinerea is also unaffected in powdery mildew resistant4, despite the fact that callose accumulation was almost abolished in this mutant. These results indicate that the OG-induced oxidative burst is not required for the activation of defense responses effective against B. cinerea, leaving open the question of the role of reactive oxygen species in elicitor-mediated defense.
