Crop-to-crop transgene flow will affect seed purity of non-GM rice varieties, leading to unwanted consequences. To assess the maximum probability of transgene outflow in rice (Oryza sativa), gene flow experiments were conducted with three cultivation patterns with different mixed-planting proportions of adjacent GM and non-GM rice at two sites in Fujian and Hainan Provinces of China. Three GM rice lines containing two insect-resistance genes (Bt/CpTI) and their non-GM counterparts were used in the experiments to allow natural hybridization to occur. A hygromycin resistance gene was used as a selective marker for identifying hybrids. Based on the examination of > 645 700 geminated seeds, the result showed low frequencies (0.05-0.79%) of transgene flow from GM to non-GM rice at close spacing, although with significant variation among mixed-planting proportions. It is concluded that rice transgene flow will occur at a very low frequency (< 1.0%), even if the GM rice is planted at close spacing with non-GM rice, and high densities of GM rice cultivated in the neighborhood of non-GM rice will increase the probability of outcrossing with the non-GM rice.
