['10618445', 'The locus RTM1 is necessary for restriction of long-distance movement of tobacco  etch virus in Arabidopsis thaliana without causing a hypersensitive response or  inducing systemic acquired resistance. The RTM1 gene was isolated by map-based  cloning. The deduced gene product is similar to the alpha-chain of the Artocarpus  integrifolia lectin, jacalin, and to several proteins that contain multiple  repeats of a jacalin-like sequence. These proteins comprise a family with members  containing modular organizations of one or more jacalin repeat units and are  implicated in defense against viruses, fungi, and insects.', '2000 Jan 4', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.97.1.489', 'Carrington']
