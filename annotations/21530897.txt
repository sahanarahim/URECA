['21530897', 'EDR2 is a negative regulator of the defense response and cell death in  Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function of EDR2 leads to enhanced resistance to powdery  mildew. To identify new components in the EDR2 signal transduction pathway,  mutations that suppress edr2 resistant phenotypes were screened. Three mutants,  edts5-1, edts5-2 and edts5-3 (edrtwo suppressor 5), were identified. The EDTS5  gene was identified by map-based cloning and previously was shown to encode an  aminotransferase (ALD1). Therefore we renamed these three alleles ald1-10,  ald1-11 and ald1-12, respectively. Mutations in ALD1 suppressed all edr2-mediated  phenotypes, including powdery mildew resistance, programmed cell death and  ethylene-induced senescence. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in edr2 was also  suppressed by ald1 mutation. The expression of defense-related genes was  up-regulated in the edr2 mutant, and the up-regulation of those genes in edr2 was  suppressed in the edr2/ald1 double mutant. The ald1 single mutant displayed  delayed ethylene-induced senescence. In addition, ald1 mutation suppressed  edr1-mediated powdery mildew resistance, but could not suppress the edr1/edr2  double-mutant phenotype. These data demonstrate that ALD1 plays important roles  in edr2-mediated defense responses, and senescence and revealed a crosstalk  between ethylene and salicylic acid signaling mediated by ALD1 and EDR2.', '2011 Apr 20', 'J Genet Genomics', '10.1016/j.jgg.2011.03.001', 'Tang']
