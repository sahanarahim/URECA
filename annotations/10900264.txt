['10900264', 'Gene-for-gene disease resistance typically includes a programmed cell death  response known as the hypersensitive response (HR). The Arabidopsis thaliana dnd1  mutant was previously isolated as a line that failed to produce the HR in  response to avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pathogens; plants homozygous for the  recessive dnd1-1 mutation still carry out effective gene-for-gene resistance. The  dnd1-1 mutation also causes constitutive systemic resistance and elevated levels  of salicylic acid. In the present study, a positional cloning approach was used  to isolate DND1. DND1 encodes the same protein as AtCNGC2, a cyclic  nucleotide-gated ion channel of previously unknown organismal function that can  allow passage of Ca(2+), K(+) and other cations [Leng, Q., Mercier, R. W., Yao,  W. & Berkowitz, G. A. (1999) Plant Physiol. 121, 753-761]. By using a nahG  transgene, we found that salicylic acid is required for the elevated resistance  caused by the dnd1 mutation but that removal of salicylic acid did not completely  eliminate the dwarf and loss-of-HR phenotypes of mutant dnd1 plants. A stop codon  that would severely truncate the DND1 gene product was identified in the dnd1-1  allele. This demonstrates that broad-spectrum disease resistance and inhibition  of the HR can be activated in plants by disruption of a cyclic nucleotide-gated  ion channel.', '2000 Aug 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.150005697', 'Bent']
