['19439664', "The role of RNA metabolism in chromatin silencing is now widely recognized. We  have studied the Arabidopsis RNA-binding protein FCA that down-regulates an  endogenous floral repressor gene through a chromatin mechanism involving histone  demethylase activity. This mechanism needs FCA to interact with an RNA 3'  processing/polyadenylation factor (FY/Pfs2p), but the subsequent events leading  to chromatin changes are unknown. Here, we show that this FCA-FY interaction is  required for general chromatin silencing roles where hairpin transgenes induce  DNA methylation of an endogenous gene. We also show 2 conserved RNA processing  factors, AtCPSF100 and AtCPSF160, but not FCA, are stably associated with FY in  vivo and form a range of different-sized complexes. A hypomorphic fy allele  producing a shorter protein, able to provide some FY functions but unable to  interact with FCA, reduces abundance of some of the larger MW complexes.  Suppressor mutants, which specifically disrupt the FY motif through which FCA  interacts, also lacked these larger complexes. Our data support a model whereby  FCA, perhaps after recognition of a specific RNA feature, transiently interacts  with FY, an integral component of the canonical RNA 3' processing machinery,  changing the interactions of the different RNA processing components. These  altered interactions would appear to be a necessary step in this RNA-mediated  chromatin silencing.", '2009 May 26', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0903444106', 'Dean']
