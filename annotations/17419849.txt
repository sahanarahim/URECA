['17419849', 'Protein kinases play important roles in relaying information from perception of a  signal to the effector genes in all organisms. Cysteine-rich receptor-like  kinases (CRKs) constitute a sub-family of plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) with  more than 40 members that contain the novel C-X8-C-X2-C motif (DUF26) in the  extracellular domains. Here we report molecular characterization of one member of  this gene family, CRK13. Expression of this gene is induced more quickly and  strongly in response to the avirulent compared with the virulent strains of  Pseudomonas syringae, and peaks within 4 h after pathogen infection. In response  to dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, plants expressing the CRK13 gene from a  DEX-inducible promoter exhibited all tested features of pathogen defense  activation, including rapid tissue collapse, accumulation of high levels of  several defense-related gene transcripts including PR1, PR5 and ICS1, and  accumulation of salicylic acid (SA). In addition, these plants suppressed growth  of virulent pathogens by about 20-fold compared with the wild-type Col-0.  CRK13-conferred pathogen resistance is salicylic acid-dependent. Gene expression  analysis using custom cDNA microarrays revealed a remarkable overlap between the  expression profiles of the plants overexpressing CRK13 and the plants treated  with Pst DC3000 (avrRpm1). Our studies suggest that upregulation of CRK13 leads  to hypersensitive response-associated cell death, and induces defense against  pathogens by causing increased accumulation of salicylic acid.', '2007 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03064.x', 'Raina']
