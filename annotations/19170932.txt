['19170932', 'Plant immune responses to pathogens are often associated with enhanced production  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), known as the oxidative burst, and with rapid  hypersensitive host cell death (the hypersensitive response, HR) at sites of  attempted infection. It is generally accepted that the oxidative burst acts as a  promotive signal for HR, and that HR is highly correlated with efficient disease  resistance. We have identified the Arabidopsis mutant rph1 (resistance to  Phytophthora 1), which is susceptible to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora  brassicae despite rapid induction of HR. The susceptibility of rph1 was specific  for P. brassicae and coincided with a reduced oxidative burst, a runaway  cell-death response, and failure to properly activate the expression of  defence-related genes. From these results, we conclude that, in the immune  response to P. brassicae, (i) HR is not sufficient to stop the pathogen, (ii) HR  initiation can occur in the absence of a major oxidative burst, (iii) the  oxidative burst plays a role in limiting the spread of cell death, and (iv) RPH1  is a positive regulator of the P. brassicae-induced oxidative burst and enhanced  expression of defence-related genes. Surprisingly, RPH1 encodes an evolutionary  highly conserved chloroplast protein, indicating a function of this organelle in  activation of a subset of immune reactions in response to P. brassicae. The  disease resistance-related role of RPH1 was not limited to the Arabidopsis model  system. Silencing of the potato homolog StRPH1 in a resistant potato cultivar  caused susceptibility to the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03779.x', 'Mauch']
