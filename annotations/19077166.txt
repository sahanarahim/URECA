Systemic resistance is induced by necrotizing pathogenic microbes and non-pathogenic rhizobacteria and confers protection against a broad range of pathogens. Here we show that Arabidopsis GDSL LIPASE-LIKE 1 (GLIP1) plays an important role in plant immunity, eliciting both local and systemic resistance in plants. GLIP1 functions independently of salicylic acid but requires ethylene signaling. Enhancement of GLIP1 expression in plants increases resistance to pathogens including Alternaria brassicicola, Erwinia carotovora and Pseudomonas syringae, and limits their growth at the infection site. Furthermore, local treatment with GLIP1 proteins is sufficient for the activation of systemic resistance, inducing both resistance gene expression and pathogen resistance in systemic leaves. The PDF1.2-inducing activity accumulates in petiole exudates in a GLIP1-dependent manner and is fractionated in the size range of less than 10 kDa as determined by size exclusion chromatography. Our results demonstrate that GLIP1-elicited systemic resistance is dependent on ethylene signaling and provide evidence that GLIP1 may mediate the production of a systemic signaling molecule(s).
