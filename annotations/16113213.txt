['16113213', 'Drought and salt stress tolerance of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants  increased following treatment with the nonprotein amino acid beta-aminobutyric  acid (BABA), known as an inducer of resistance against infection of plants by  numerous pathogens. BABA-pretreated plants showed earlier and higher expression  of the salicylic acid-dependent PR-1 and PR-5 and the abscisic acid  (ABA)-dependent RAB-18 and RD-29A genes following salt and drought stress.  However, non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 and constitutive expressor  of pathogenesis-related genes 1 mutants as well as transgenic NahG plants, all  affected in the salicylic acid signal transduction pathway, still showed  increased salt and drought tolerance after BABA treatment. On the contrary, the  ABA deficient 1 and ABA insensitive 4 mutants, both impaired in the ABA-signaling  pathway, could not be protected by BABA application. Our data demonstrate that  BABA-induced water stress tolerance is based on enhanced ABA accumulation  resulting in accelerated stress gene expression and stomatal closure. Here, we  show a possibility to increase plant tolerance for these abiotic stresses through  effective priming of the preexisting defense pathways without resorting to  genetic alterations.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.065698', 'Mauch-Mani']
