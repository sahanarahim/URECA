['10978297', 'Salicylic acid (SA) is required for resistance to many diseases in higher plants.  SA-dependent cell death and defense-related responses have been correlated with  disease resistance. The accelerated cell death 5 mutant of Arabidopsis provides  additional genetic evidence that SA regulates cell death and defense-related  responses. However, in acd5, these events are uncoupled from disease resistance.  acd5 plants are more susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae early in development and  show spontaneous SA accumulation, cell death, and defense-related markers later  in development. In acd5 plants, cell death and defense-related responses are SA  dependent but they do not confer disease resistance. Double mutants with acd5 and  nonexpressor of PR1, in which SA signaling is partially blocked, show greatly  attenuated cell death, indicating a role for NPR1 in controlling cell death. The  hormone ethylene potentiates the effects of SA and is important for disease  symptom development in Arabidopsis. Double mutants of acd5 and ethylene  insensitive 2, in which ethylene signaling is blocked, show decreased cell death,  supporting a role for ethylene in cell death control. We propose that acd5 plants  mimic P. syringae-infected wild-type plants and that both SA and ethylene are  normally involved in regulating cell death during some susceptible pathogen  infections.', '2000 Sep', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/156.1.341', 'Liang']
