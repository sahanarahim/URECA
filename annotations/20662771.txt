Bioimaging contributes significantly to our understanding of plant virus infections. In the present review, we describe technical advances that enable imaging of the infection process at previously unobtainable levels. We highlight how such new advances in subcellular imaging are contributing to a detailed dissection of all stages of the viral infection process. Specifically, we focus on: (i) the increasingly detailed localizations of viral proteins enabled by a diversifying palette of cellular markers; (ii) approaches using fluorescence microscopy for the functional analysis of proteins in vivo; (iii) the imaging of viral RNAs; (iv) methods that bridge the gap between optical and electron microscopy; and (v) methods that are blurring the distinction between imaging and structural biology. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of such techniques and place them in the broader perspective of their utility in analysing plant virus infection.
