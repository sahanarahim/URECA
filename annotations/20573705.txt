['20573705', 'The silent information regulator protein (Sir2) and its homologs are  NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase enzymes that play important roles in a variety of  physiological processes. However, the functions of the Sir2 family in plants are  poorly understood. Here, we report that Arabidopsis AtSRT2, a homolog of yeast  Sir2, negatively regulates plant basal defense against the pathogen Pseudomonas  syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PstDC3000). In response to PstDC3000 infection, the  expression of AtSRT2 was down-regulated in a salicylic acid (SA)-independent  manner. In addition, knock-out of AtSRT2 (srt2) enhanced resistance against  PstDC3000 and increased expression of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (PR1).  Conversely, overexpression of AtSRT2 resulted in hypersusceptibility to PstDC3000  and impaired PR1 induction. Consistent with this phenotype, expression of PAD4,  EDS5 and SID2, three essential genes in the SA biosynthesis pathway, were  increased in the srt2 mutant and decreased in AtSRT2-overexpressing plants. Taken  together, these results demonstrate that AtSRT2 is a negative regulator of basal  defense, possibly by suppressing SA biosynthesis.', '2010 Aug', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcq087', 'Li']
