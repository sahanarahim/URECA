Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play important roles in diverse developmental and physiological processes of plants, including pathogen-induced defense responses. Although at least 17 rice MAPKs have been identified and more than half of these MAPK genes have been shown to be pathogen or elicitor responsive, the exact role of most of the MAPKs in host-pathogen interaction is unknown. Here we report that OsMPK6 is an important regulator in rice disease resistance. Suppressing OsMPK6 or knocking out of OsMPK6 enhanced rice resistance to different races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The resistant plants showed increased expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning in the NH1 (an Arabidopsis NPR1 orthologue)-involved defense signal transduction pathway. These results suggest that OsMPK6 functions as a repressor to regulate rice defense responses upon bacterial invasion.
