['16473969', 'Arabidopsis thaliana is a host to the powdery mildew Erysiphe cichoracearum and  nonhost to Blumeria graminis f. sp hordei, the powdery mildew pathogenic on  barley (Hordeum vulgare). Screening for Arabidopsis mutants deficient in  resistance to barley powdery mildew identified PENETRATION3 (PEN3). pen3 plants  permitted both increased invasion into epidermal cells and initiation of hyphae  by B. g. hordei, suggesting that PEN3 contributes to defenses at the cell wall  and intracellularly. pen3 mutants were compromised in resistance to the  necrotroph Plectosphaerella cucumerina and to two additional inappropriate  biotrophs, pea powdery mildew (Erysiphe pisi) and potato late blight  (Phytophthora infestans). Unexpectedly, pen3 mutants were resistant to E.  cichoracearum. This resistance was salicylic acid-dependent and correlated with  chlorotic patches. Consistent with this observation, salicylic acid pathway genes  were hyperinduced in pen3 relative to the wild type. The phenotypes conferred by  pen3 result from the loss of function of PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE8 (PDR8), a  highly expressed putative ATP binding cassette transporter. PEN3/PDR8 tagged with  green fluorescent protein localized to the plasma membrane in uninfected cells.  In infected leaves, the protein concentrated at infection sites. PEN3/PDR8 may be  involved in exporting toxic materials to attempted invasion sites, and  intracellular accumulation of these toxins in pen3 may secondarily activate the  salicylic acid pathway.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.038372', 'Somerville']
