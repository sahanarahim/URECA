['10339621', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 has been shown to be a key regulator of gene  expression during the onset of a plant disease-resistance response known as  systemic acquired resistance. The npr1 mutant plants fail to respond to systemic  acquired resistance-inducing signals such as salicylic acid (SA), or express  SA-induced pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Using NPR1 as bait in a yeast  two-hybrid screen, we identified a subclass of transcription factors in the basic  leucine zipper protein family (AHBP-1b and TGA6) and showed that they interact  specifically in yeast and in vitro with NPR1. Point mutations that abolish the  NPR1 function in A. thaliana also impair the interactions between NPR1 and the  transcription factors in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, a gel mobility  shift assay showed that the purified transcription factor protein, AHBP-1b, binds  specifically to an SA-responsive promoter element of the A. thaliana PR-1 gene.  These data suggest that NPR1 may regulate PR-1 gene expression by interacting  with a subclass of basic leucine zipper protein transcription factors.', '1999 May 25', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.96.11.6523', 'Dong']
