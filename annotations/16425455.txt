We have established an efficient particle-bombardment transformation protocol for the diploid non-apomictic genotype of the warm season forage crop Paspalum notatum (bahiagrass). A vector containing a herbicide resistance gene (bar) together with the GUS reporter gene was used in transformation experiments. The bar gene confers resistance to the herbicide bialaphos. An improved culture system, highly regenerative callus, dense in compact polyembryogenic clusters, was produced on medium with a high CuSO4 content at elevated temperature. Target tissue (360 calli) produced under these conditions yielded 52 rooted plants on herbicide-containing medium, and 22 of these plants were PCR-positive. DNA gel blot analysis revealed a copy number of 1-5 for the GUS gene in different independent transformants. There was no correlation between copy number and GUS activity. While conventional cultures yielded exclusively albino plants on herbicide-containing medium, improved culture conditions for the target tissue resulted in the recovery of 100% green transgenic plants. All green herbicide-resistant regenerants were morphological normal and fertile.
