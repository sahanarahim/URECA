['23116333', 'BACKGROUND: NPR1 is a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana required for the perception of  salicylic acid. This perception triggers a defense response and negatively  regulates the perception of jasmonates. Surprisingly, the application of methyl  jasmonate also induces resistance, and NPR1 is also suspected to be relevant.  Since an allelic series of npr1 was recently described, the behavior of these  alleles was tested in response to methyl jasmonate. RESULTS: The response to  methyl jasmonate of different npr1s alleles and NPR1 paralogs null mutants was  measured by the growth of a pathogen. We have also tested the subcellular  localization of some npr1s, along with the protein-protein interactions that can  be measured in yeast. The localization of the protein in npr1 alleles does not  affect the response to methyl jasmonate. In fact, NPR1 is not required. The genes  that are required in a redundant fashion are the BOPs. The BOPs are paralogs of  NPR1, and they physically interact with the TGA family of transcription factors.  CONCLUSIONS: Some npr1 alleles have a phenotype in this response likely because  they are affecting the interaction between BOPs and TGAs, and these two families  of proteins are responsible for the resistance induced by methyl jasmonate in  wild type plants.', '2012 Nov 2', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-12-199', 'Tornero']
