['9548982', 'In Arabidopsis, NPR1 mediates the salicylic acid (SA)-induced expression of  pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Here, we  report the identification of another component, CPR 6, that may function with  NPR1 in regulating PR gene expression. The dominant CPR 6-1 mutant expresses the  SA/NPR1-regulated PR genes (PR-1, BGL 2, and PR-5) and displays enhanced  resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola ES4326 and Peronospora  parasitica Noco2 in the absence of SAR induction. cpr 6-1-induced PR gene  expression is not suppressed in the cpr 6-1 npr1-1 double mutant but is  suppressed when SA is removed by salicylate hydroxylase. Thus, constitutive PR  gene expression in cpr 6-1 requires SA but not NPR1. In addition, resistance to  P. s. maculicola ES4326 is suppressed in the cpr 6-1 npr1-1 double mutant,  despite expression of PR-1, BGL 2, and PR-5. Resistance to P. s. maculicola  ES4326 must therefore be accomplished through unidentified antibacterial gene  products that are regulated through NPR1. These results show that CPR 6 is an  important regulator of multiple signal transduction pathways involved in plant  defense.', '1998 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.4.557', 'Dong']
