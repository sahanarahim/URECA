Recent studies have suggested that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induce nitric oxide (NO) production and defense gene expression in plants. Our current work investigated the signaling mechanism of NO and the role of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (NPR1) in LPS-induced innate immunity of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We have provided evidence that LPS-elicited NO generation as well as increased antioxidant enzyme activities capable of maintaining the redox state could be important to protect plants against oxidative damage from pathogen attack. In addition, LPS-activated defense responses, including callose deposition and defense-related gene expression, are regulated through an NPR1-dependent signaling pathway. Our results contribute to elucidation of the signaling mechanism of NO and highlight an important role of NPR1 in modulating LPS-triggered innate immunity in plants. However, further research is necessary to clarify the cross-talk between mitochondria and NO on activating LPS-induced defense responses, and the regulatory mechanism of NO in LPS-induced innate immunity needs further improvement.
