['9144959', 'Thionins are antimicrobial proteins that are thought to be involved in plant  defense. Concordant with this view, we have recently shown that the Arabidopsis  thionin Thi2.1 gene is inducible by phytopathogenic fungi. Here, we demonstrate  that constitutive overexpression of this thionin enhances the resistance of the  susceptible ecotype Columbia (Col-2) against attack by Fusarium oxysporum f sp  matthiolae. Transgenic lines had a reduced loss of chlorophyll after inoculation  and supported significantly less fungal growth on the cotyledons, as evaluated by  trypan blue staining. Moreover, fungi on cotyledons of transgenic lines had more  hyphae with growth anomalies, including hyperbranching, than on cotyledons of the  parental line. No transcripts for pathogenesis-related PR-1, PR-5, or the  pathogen-inducible plant defensin Pdf1.2 could be detected in uninoculated  transgenic seedlings, indicating that all of the observed effects of the  overexpressing lines are most likely the result of the toxicity of the THI2.1  thionin. Our findings strongly support the view that thionins are defense  proteins.', '1997 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.9.4.509', 'Bohlmann']
