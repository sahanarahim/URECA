['28712931', 'Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a reactive oxygen species that affects cell  signaling in various plant defense responses and induces programmed cell death.  To identify the new components associated with H(2)O(2) signaling and tolerance,  we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the root growth of 133  Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown in the presence of toxic H(2)O(2) levels.  The most significant SNPs were associated with a cluster of chromosome 4 genes  encoding an aquaporin NODULIN 26-LIKE INTRINSIC PROTEIN 1; 1 (NIP1;1), an NB-ARC  domain-containing disease resistance protein (AT4G19050), and a putative membrane  lipoprotein (AT4G19070). The expression level of NIP1;1 was relatively high in  A. thaliana accessions sensitive to H(2)O(2). Additionally, overexpression of  NIP1;1 in a tolerant accession (e.g., Col-0) increased the sensitivity of  transgenic plants to H(2)O(2). An in planta beta-glucuronidase reporter assay  revealed that variations in the NIP1;1 promoter were responsible for the  differences of its expression level in H(2)O(2)-tolerant and -sensitive  accessions. Cell death was extensive and H(2)O(2) levels were high in the roots  of H(2)O(2)-sensitive and NIP1;1-overexpressing accessions. Together, our results  indicate that the aquaporin NIP1;1 is a key determinant of the sensitivity of  A. thaliana to H(2)O(2), and contributes to the phenotypic variations detected by  our GWAS.', '2017 Aug 7', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2017.07.003', 'Koyama']
