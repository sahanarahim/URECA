['20444226', 'Previous studies have shown that subunits E (eIF3e), F (eIF3f) and H (elF3h) of  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 play important roles in cell  development in humans and yeast. eIF3e and eIF3h have also been reported to be  important for normal cell growth in Arabidopsis. However, the functions of  subunit eIF3f remain largely unknown in plant species. Here we report  characterization of mutants for the Arabidopsis eIF3f (AteIF3f) gene. AteIF3f  encodes a protein that is highly expressed in pollen grains, developing embryos  and root tips, and interacts with Arabidopsis eIF3e and eIF3h proteins. A Ds  insertional mutation in AteIF3f disrupted pollen germination and embryo  development. Expression of some of the genes that are essential for pollen tube  growth and embryogenesis is down-regulated in ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings  obtained by pollen rescue. These results suggested that AteIF3f might play  important roles in Arabidopsis cell growth and differentiation in combination  with eIF3e and eIF3h.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04237.x', 'Ye']
